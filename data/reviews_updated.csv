It offers a wide range of options, from high-end brands to more affordable choices. The food selection is impressive as well, featuring favorites like PS Cafe, Tambuah Mas, and many others. I often visit this mall, especially during my pregnancy and postpartum period. I particularly love the fifth floor, where all the kids' shops are located. There's even a small playground that my child enjoys.",feedback

Paragon Shopping Centre,1,Angie,"Was at Paragon yesterday evening between 6.30-7.30. Visited a Club 21 pop up sale store on level 2. The experience there with the so call salesperson wasnâ€™t good. The store was selling most brands from Club 21 were slashing prices up to 70- 80 percent discount. I asked to reserved a pair of shoes in the afternoon and put at the counter as I need to rush off to meet clients. As a salesperson myself, this service given to me was below standard. Club 21 is a respectable company in Singapore having this young managers with no respect to customer is very bad. When I went back to buy the shoes, I couldnâ€™t find it, so one lady brought out the shoes and told me itâ€™s sales item, you asked my part time to keep for you she donâ€™t know anything , if we sold the shoes away there is nothing we can do! This sentence , sounds rude to me. She looked down on customers that are buying sales item, if she canâ€™t respect customers that are buying sales item, DONâ€™T GIVE DISCOUNT period.",feedback
Paragon Shopping Centre,2,joel chan,"I'm usually quite hesitant to leave negative reviews but I hope this won't be the experience of others in the future. I was at Paragon today and really needed to charge my phone and when I walked past the concierge I noticed that they had a sign stating that they offer portable chargers. When I went up to ask if I could borrow or rent one, the lady at the concierge didn't even look at me until i paused to wait for her to look up and assumed she was busy even though she already said ""hi"" while looking down. She then told me I had to pay a $50 deposit to borrow the portable charger, which I am completely fine with and understand the need for. She appeared shocked when I said I was fine with the $50 deposit so I just said it again that I was completely fine with it. She continued staring at me and just said ""$50 deposit"" which honestly confused me because she didn't ask me how I wanted to pay and didn't tell me only cash was accepted and repeated it until I asked her if only cash payment was available. I then told her that i didn't have cash and asked if card payment was available to which she replied ""there's an ATM""... I don't carry cash around and that's not her fault but I really think that for a mall like  paragon that the staff, especially at the concierge to have some sort of customer service training. I also think it would be a good idea to allow for card payment for the $50 deposit as many don't carry cash anymore especially if it is advertised at the concierge.",feedback
Paragon Shopping Centre,5,Rebecca Maki,"Always the most atas shopping mall in Orchard to me. We can find a lot of good stuff and food there. Including kid's apparel.

Paragon Shopping Centre,5,Marklin Ho,"An opulence of peace, quiet and decorum is brought to life here 

I love the atmosphere of this shopping mall because people here seem to be more well-mannered and cordial  less uncouth behaviour like the lazy dragging of shoes / slippers when walking and none of that barbaric â€œschatum schatumâ€ sound when chewing food. Of course, nothing wrong with that if you have such habits as all are born and brought up differently.

Plenty of malls with more relaxed demeanour and bustling with noise which is fine to immerse myself in once a while. However, I prefer peace and quiet if I have the choice and Paragon is highly recommended if you live or work nearby â¤ï¸ or like me, prefer an environment which oozes out such a prized commodity (peace and quiet) in Singapore with ease.",feedback
Paragon Shopping Centre,4,sam Mariella,"PARAGON had been renovated and face-lift   as we see it today.  The facade is beautiful, there is a sense of spacious, be it you stand outside at the entrance, or when you walk first time inside.

It is not the biggest in orchard, probably stood as the medium size with several world  class boutiques.

At basement, there are midi supermarket. ( Cold storage), restorants ( Ding Tai Fung, LA shrimp, Soup, etc) cafes and booths. I like to stroll at basement. Crystal Jade is at 5 FL.

Door to baby changing room doesn't shut at all, whatever happened to privacy? Changing table is not ergonomically thought of. Who designed all these? And nursing room is too small to fit a pram, so have to leave pram outside (with sliding door stuck and open to passersby. Any Tom Dick Harry can come in to take the hot water.

When I asked for fresh towels and water, the receptionist said I had to request cleaning, which was never told to us before.

At checkout, they unfairly deducted 10 SGD from my deposit, showing only a photo of a â€œdirty towelâ€ without letting me verify in person. This was dishonest and unreasonable.

Very poor service, hidden policies, and unprofessional staff. I will never stay here again.",feedback
Hotel Calmo Bugis,,Trip.com Member,The apartment is too small and the receptionist took the deposit of USD 100 which she wanted to forfeit by showing old stain of bedsheet. However the manager shabana and cleaner lady acknowledged that this was old stain and they refunded the money. The attitude issue of staff needs to be polished.  Rest is absolutely fine with good beds and washroom. Near to bugies street MRT,feedback

Hotel Calmo Bugis,,johnmS9898FE,Stay here at your peril. Total scammers .|The accommodation to start is as basic as it comes. No insulation so any noise from other rooms can be heard constantly.Sheets are old and threadbare same as the towels.|But if by some chance you leave the slightest stain that could easily be washed out on either a sheet or a towel you will not get your deposit back.|Charged us $140 because of 3 minute stains 2 on a bedsheet and 1 on a towel .|Whereas some of the sheets had holes in!|Even after we cleaned the stains ourselves with a little bit of warm water they refused to return our deposit. Stating the stains where there so it is in our policy to charge you.|Also ended up with bites from bed bugs as many other reviews have stated.|Disgusting attitude and suffice to say the Manager was the first to state â€˜we are not trying to scam youâ€™|Steer clear or youâ€™ll regret it.,rant
Hotel Calmo Bugis,,Trip.com Member,Hotel is in great location. I noticed the night staff at the reception wasn't helpful when you asked for something. The room was good but the toilet would be better if it was so not transparent. I can literally see the person shower. Not so friendly for families. Also the toilet water pressure wasn't that great. Room insulation wasn't great either. But other thank that everything else is good. There's room for improvement for sure.,feedback

Hotel Calmo Bugis,,Trip.com Member,Iâ€™m giving this a poor service as the hotelâ€™s management really did not consider giving me a refund for the booking that I made by mistake. Yes I acknowledge that it was my fault as I booked for July24 instead of June24 but its really clear that it was made by mistake since I was in the actual hotel when I made the booking. I told the receptionist that I just cancel the July24 and book a different one (June24). The receptionist also cant do anything on their end.This was supposed to be just an extension of our stay as we dont want to be staying at the airport anymore (as originally planned). The hotel really did not consider my request of cancellation refund. Trip was kind enough to give me trip coins for the misfortune.,feedback

As a result, the cousin chose to book another hotel to avoid further issues. The sender is requesting clarification on the hotel's policies, emphasizing that consent was given and adults were present at check-in. They also noted that no manager was available when they called. They didn't stated clearly about the extra fee, underage policy at all when upon arriving basically no one was there at the counter  until another family came in to ask for requiry suddenly a Malay lady appear who seems to be polite but isn't she was the one who give false information and keep wasting time for the guests to check in...worse service and attitude problem receptionist",feedback

Hotel Calmo Bugis,,Trip.com Member,"We recently stayed at Hotel Calmo Bugis and had a pleasant experience overall. The hotel's location is quite convenient, being just 300m from Bugis MRT and with a bus station right in front of the building, making it easy to get around Singapore.  One of the highlights is that the hotel is surrounded by plenty of restaurants, though if you're looking for halal food, youâ€™ll need to walk around 600m. Itâ€™s still manageable, but something to keep in mind.  As for the room, we stayed in a quad room,which was decent in size and comfortable for our stay. While itâ€™s not overly spacious, it provided what we needed for a good rest. The toilet was clean, which is always a plus.

Hotel Calmo Bugis,,Trip.com Member,"Absolutely loved our stay here! SG was a sudden family trip so I booked this on a rush last June 5th to 8th. It was our first time in SG and we opted to stay around Bugis. The hotel's location is quite strategic because its near the MRT, 5 to 10 mins walk to Bugis street or Albert Centre, good food and lively neighborhood. We stayed on 6th floor, had an amazing view from our corner room. The room itself is clean and comfy for its price. Clean shower. Maybe the only downside was the aircon, it took quite a long time to cool down the room but it was fine.The staff were kind specially the receptionist, Tricia/Trisha, I don't know how to spell her name, was lovely and very accommodating to us, on our last day the rain was pouring and she offered her umbrella just so we can have our breakfast around the neighborhood and even recommended some spots around.

Hotel Calmo Bugis,5,Settasilp Poonbumphen,"I stayed at Hotel Calmo Bugis from October 14th to 17th, and it exceeded my expectations in many ways. The room was quite spacious for two peopleâ€”it could easily accommodate three, with a king-size bed and a sofa couch. The amenities were more than sufficient, with shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, a hair dryer, and an abundance of power outlets (including USB ports). Iâ€™m not sure why there were so many outlets, but it was definitely convenient!

One thing to note is that housekeeping needs to be requested daily, though I found this acceptable. The service overall was good, and both check-in and check-out were incredibly fast and efficient.

The only downside to my stay was the slow internet, which was disappointing. However, I would still recommend Hotel Calmo Bugis for anyone looking for a simple yet fully functional hotel in a great location. Itâ€™s close to Bugis Junction, where you can find everything you need, and thereâ€™s even a fantastic mala buffet near the entrance.",feedback

Just make sure to tap your access card before pressing the floor, and not the other way around.When we entered the room, it was spacious. Industrial design. Can easily lay 3 open luggages.

Only a handful actually. And Hotel Calmo Bugis is one of them.The alley adjacent to the hotel are all food stalls so no need to worry about food. Theres also a convenience store at the other end.

The doorknob had issues when we were there, so we were instead issued the room's master key (which apparently was their only copy, so when housekeeping was requested, the staff couldn't go into the room :)))).

Basically there were issues that even us flexible guests found a bit bothersome that definitely had a dent in our experience while staying. Although there are some good things: bathroom was clean and spacious, good location (a lot of sightseeing spots are very near).

They donâ€™t have any hanger rack on the bathroom so your new clothes or bath towel no place inside of the bathroom. You have to go outside with your roommate nude to get your new clothes and bath towel. Sink are lightly clogged too. We also asked for new coffee cup and additional cup and they said, thereâ€™s no extra cup. OMG! So how to we clean our used cup?? So I let them to wash our used cup but the man who washed our cup do the angry face with us, bad look with us which is so rude. So for me, this place is a big NO. I wonâ€™t comeback on this hotel.

Actual rating: 3.5*

*Taking into account value for money

I was here a few weeks ago (and drank teh tarik siu dai), didn't know this is a Srisun Express outlet 

Now I'm back to eat Indian rojak for breakfast....

Had wanted to try the ""famous"" prata at this HDB block (681) but decided to pass as #MHTamChiak isn't too keen on crispy (but super oily) kosong (no matter how good the curry is) 

They have prata here as well, but no hurry to try as I've eaten at Srisun (Sgoon Gdns) before -- I expect a similar standard (though I think it had gone down quite a bit over the years ).

I checked if they had to re-fry the rojak pieces, as I'd rather not have them oily. Too bad, they had to as some items are actually not fully cooked!

So there went the cuttlefish, deep fried till it had a ""skin"". Definitely not to my liking as it destroyed the texture 

Otherwise, the rojak pieces are rather fresh, as can be seen with the tau kwa 

Potato, small fish cake and plain dough ball were also very good 

So next time I'll just leave out the cuttlefish lol

The gravy is light and hardly contained peanuts!? It tasted slightly spicy, which really went well with the rojak. Usually I will have to ask for another serving... and so I did! 

Strangely, they weren't generous with cut cucumber -- a staple that's great to dunk into the gravy -- and green chilli.

Overall, this was a satisfying and full breakfast. Complete with the requisite teh tarik, of course 

But at $9.90 for this meal -- tea alone is 2.40! -- I'm not keen to return as there are other wallet friendly places to enjoy good rojak!",feedback
Srisun Express - Hougang Ave 8,3,Gavin Koh,"Priced a little too expensive food for a heartland store. My order was $9.40 for 2 egg pratas and 2 teh tariks whereas I could have paid only $6.40 elsewhere.

The scan-the-QR-code-and-order menu wasn't working that well; it was very laggy or seemed to have hung. Even the waitress came to confirm whether I had ordered correctly (after I managed to get it to work on my phone... by patiently waiting). The waitress probably anticipated problems with ordering.

At least the food was hot and arrived quite fast, but the prata looked rather small, as if less dough was used; curry was just enough and quite tasty and slightly crispy. The teh tarik was OK, nothing spectacular.

Sorry, price point is what fails here and it's not as if the ambience was helping much. Sure, it felt breezy enough with the fans going at full blast. But, it's a no from me.",feedback

Srisun Express - Hougang Ave 8,4,Josh Kuek (#jkgourmets),"Newest Indian Mamak stall in Hougang. Located in the corner beside cross junction traffic. Very spacious and well decorated, quite comfortable and cossy seating near the roadside.

They serve full Indian menu from Prata, Dosai to Rojak, Briyani to all stir fried comfort foods and of course all traditional drinks.

First, we try their Indian Rojak, very crispy and quite fresh fried stuffed. Dipping potato chilli gravy was not bad too.
We also tried their Dosai, just the plain one, taste was good unfortunately not so crispy and dipping sauces was slightly not to plain, lack of flavours.

In the other day, we take away 2 pieces of grilled Naan bread, wow, it was very fluffy, fragrance, and delicious. Slight sweet and savory taste. Veylry well balanced flavors. Unfortunately, 2 pieces cost $5.50 was too expensive, it was only a plain bread without filling.

On my third visit, trying new dishes, instead of plain thosai, this time I try masala thosai, which is potatoes fillings, very delicious, worth my first try. Yummy.

Another new dish was a fried Bee Hoon with tandoori chicken set, price at $13 each. You have option of the carb, either Fried Rice, Mee, Bee Hoon, Kway-Tiao or Maggi Mee. It was delicious, especially my fried Bee-Hoon, is moist and not oily, and full of wok-hey. Tandoori chicken is yummy but slightly dry inside, can be better.

Overall, I do recommend this Indian stall to all, due to it tidy, clean, comfort and cossy atmosphere. Foods was not bad, table and chairs and environment was clean too, unfortunately, price was slightly high for me. Nevertheless, try it especially if you never visit.

Srisun Express - Hougang Ave 8,5,Avriel Peter,"Canâ€™t believe what I just ate! Such fantastic indian cuisine. Ive been travelling around trying different indian food, and even had 3 friends from india teaching me how to eat poori, naan and all sorts of interesting food yesterday. Decided to try Sri Sun today since it is close to my home.

The cost is really good. Higher than other places, but the value was so much more! Eg the poori came with a wholesome amount of potato filling. My nasi briyani was placed beautifully with tender succulent chicken. The curry is thick, savoury, and very flavourful.

Environment is ok. We had 7 pax, which they could handle, but 8 would not cut it unless you want a separate table.

Nitha helped us most of the time, and could explain even more on each dish (yes, we were adventurous and wanted to add some food we have not yet tasted).

Every dish that I often travel around trying, was cooked to perfection (I dare say better). Generosity from drinks to food and sauces made the meal joyful and fulfilling.

I am coming back for sure!

Couple of things for improvement:
1. Papadom was soft and hence hard to eat.
2. Needs cooling. An internal aircon or something that can cool down the place.
3. More sitting areas for 8-10pax.

Ill be sure to make a special request on #1 to be done right the next time I visit. ",feedback

The Indian rojak was served hot and super crispy. The sauce was tasty. The coin prata with the mutton set is superb.

Srisun Express - Hougang Ave 8,3,Neko Onna,"Price is slightly on the high side. We ordered Butter chicken curry which cost $8 and you wouldn't believe the size of the thing, it was tinyyy (palm sized) and we were joking bout bringing the bowl home to make it worth our while. It was good and spicy but the size of the bowl was v disappointing. Prata wise, it's definitely not as good as al falah just rite down the road. We also ordered tissue prata, which was like a huge tower, this one wasn't too bad but it did cost about $7. Mee pattaya was also not bad but nothing great

Srisun Express - Hougang Ave 8,3,FRan,"The masala tosai presentation was good. 4 diiferent varieties of the sauces. Overall it was delicious. But there is a higher price to pay at $4.5. Compared to many places, usually is around $2.5 to $3.5.

Ordered a piece of plain Plata $1.40. Here this stall accept 1 piece. Most stalls minimum you have to order 2.

Wasn't crowded compared to the one 100m away. More airy here and not stuffy.

They had scan your order QR system which was slightly laggy. Payment has to be made upon ordering. When I made my order under the remark I requested for fish gravy but it came out differently.

Srisun Express - Hougang Ave 8,3,Jia Jia Chen,"I visited Srisun Express today, and I have mixed feelings about my experience. On the positive side, the ambience was pleasant, and the restaurant maintained a clean environment. However, I was disappointed with both the food and the service.

We placed our order at 9 am, but unfortunately, they missed out on our plain prata, which left us waiting until around 9:55 am to receive it. This delay was quite frustrating.

Moreover, the honey lemon drink we ordered didn't meet our expectations. It was overpriced and tasted more like plain water with a hint of honey rather than the refreshing lemony flavor we were hoping for. Even my kids, who are usually fans of honey lemon, were disappointed and refused to drink more than a sip.

As for the food, the nasi goreng kampong was noticeably salty, which made it less enjoyable.

In the end, our meal for two adults and two kids cost us approximately $28.85, and considering the average food quality and the service hiccup, I can't say it was a particularly satisfying dining experience at Srisun Express.",feedback

Srisun Express - Hougang Ave 8,4,Makan Thoughts,"Srisun Express on Hougang Ave. 8 has been a hidden culinary gem, offering a delectable variety of fusion dishes bound to satisfy any craving. One dish that truly stood out during my visit was the Mee Goreng with Chicken Tikka and Prata.

The Mee Goreng, a quintessential Malaysian dish, was flawlessly executed at Srisun Express. The noodles were stir-fried to perfection, carrying a deep smoky flavor with a hint of spiciness. What made this particular version unique and noteworthy was the inclusion of tender Chicken Tikka pieces that added an extra dimension of taste to the dish. The flavors were well balanced, and the chicken tikka enhanced the overall savory experience. Unlike other Tikka, this is fresh from lived grill and not in microwave oven.

Accompanying the Mee Goreng was a side of Prata, which turned out to be a heavenly addition to the meal. The prata, with its crispy yet soft texture, was served piping hot and paired perfectly with the savory flavors of the Mee Goreng. It was truly a match made in culinary heaven.

The portion size was generous, ensuring that I left the restaurant feeling completely satisfied. The prices at Srisun Express are also quite reasonable for the quality and quantity of food served, making it a great value for money dining option.

The staff at Srisun Express were friendly and accommodating, providing excellent service throughout my visit. The restaurant itself has a cozy and casual ambiance, perfect for enjoying a delightful meal with friends and family.",feedback

Hotel Calmo Bugis,1,Jobelle Ann Ramos,"Take a look at the photos of the rooms, and reduce your expectations by 20x. In person, these rooms look unfinished, cluttered and can barely be called neat.

Looking at the triple room? Decrease your expectations by a further 10x. If they give you the corner rooms, 601 and 605, you'll get a little more real estate than the middle rooms. The double bed is okay, serves it's purpose and can definitely fit 2 comfortably even with a baby in between. The extra bed though, is just a single couch with an ottoman added to the end held together by a fitted sheet. And no it's not one of those plush couches, it's as cheap as couches get.

The bathroom is certainly decent. Sizeable enough with a hot and cold shower. If you're on the plus size of things, the toilet is a bit of a squeeze.

Now for the horror story. Of the 3 days we spent in this hotel, we were only able to use the elevators, twice. Twice! And we were on the 6th floor, a group that had senior citizens and a toddler. so to cap off every day of adventure, we had to go walk up the stairs to the 6th floor. We didn't even complain about it anymore, not allowing it ruin our vacation.

The day before were to depart, we gave them a heads up to let them know that we had 13 pcs of luggage between all of us and that at no point were we bringing these down the stairs ourselves. We gave them advanced notice so that they could make arrangements for this. The receptionist even tried to say they would ""help"" us carry the bags down, but we were clear to her that we would not carry 1 bag down. We were clear that they needed to carry all 13 down.

We were travelling with a toddler, and family who were in their late 40s and 50s and who all had their own share of aches and pains. We did not want to risk anyone getting injured carrying these heavy bags down flights of stairs.

Day of departure came, and they did not arrange anything. The receptionist did nothing at all to prepare, and had to carry some of the bags herself and had to wait for another staff to carry the heavier bags. we checked out at 9 am and this whole ordeal ate into our last day which was supposed to be spent enjoying more of Singapore. We were finally able to leave the hotel at 11 am,

Srisun Express - Hougang Ave 8,1,S Teo,"Ordered coin prata with sardine to go. Waited 35 minutes to be told they didnâ€™t have sardine and they asked to change to curry mutton or chicken. Which is fine but the waiting time was too long for a half filled shop. Other patrons and grab drivers also had to wait quite abit

Extensive menu, electronic systems and multiple stations. Staff was unhelpful. Curry was very salty. One star for the coin prata.

Menu prices donâ€™t include GST.

If not happy, don't work la no one is forcing U to work in the service industry..

Food took more than half an hour to arrive and I even pulled out hair from one of my dishes but I was in no mood to speak to the lady who had such a big attitude because I knew it would become a very unpleasant situation.

Srisun Express - Hougang Ave 8,1,Hari Haran,"I visited this recently and unfortunately, it was a disappointing experience. The service was not just slow. It was terrible. Despite the fact that there were hardly few customers, the service was very poor. They had an attitude that they don't care if a customer eats or walk away from the place.  Ordered a paper masala dosa & took 25 minutes to get. Certainly din expect so much delay for a simple dish. I could not imagine the kind of service offered if the restaurant was fully seated. Every waiter wants to show they are busy by walking here & there , but no one wants to consider waiting my table. Overall, I would never recommend this restaurant. I'm kinda surprised how this restaurant managed to have a 3 star review",feedback

The first time, several months back, I ordered at the counter and the cashier was distracted and messed up my order. In the end, I got it mee hoon goreng instead of mee goreng. I wasn't in the mood to argue so I took it. Yesterday, I visited again as I ran out of rice at home and didn't want to grocery shopping and then cook after that. I arrived at 7.10pm, I ordered via the paper form and waited over 20 mins for nasi ayam tambah. Something that is not even cooked to order. When the food finally arrived, they give me chicken wing part with so many bones. Whats the point of paying for top up chicken if I'm given bones only??? Slow service and subpar food.

Hotel Calmo Bugis,1,Tran Tran,"The room was very dirty and unclean when we first came in. All the pillows and the beddings were worn out, smelly, stinky. The room was dusty. They did change the beddings upon our request but it was still smelly and itchy due to being worn out. They did not clean the room, take out garbage or provide toilet paper during our 2 nights. The 3rd bed was also just a sofa, not a bed.

Don't trust the 5 star ratings, this hotel paid for it. We will not stay here again or recommend it for anyone. Truly disappointed for such a hotel in Singapore.",feedback
Hotel Calmo Bugis,,Trip.com Member,"During my recent stay at this hotel, I was disappointed by the overall experience. One of the major issues was the persistent unpleasant odor coming from the toilet. It was quite off-putting and made it difficult to feel comfortable using the bathroom facilities. Despite attempts to address the issue with the hotel staff, the problem persisted throughout my stay, negatively impacting the overall ambiance of the room.Another significant drawback of this hotel was its proximity to a noisy bar. The loud music and rowdy patrons late into the night created a constant disturbance, making it challenging to get a good night's sleep. On top of that, the thin walls offered little sound insulation, and I could clearly hear a baby crying from the neighboring room. This added to the noise disruptions and further affected the quality of my stay. Overall, the combination of the smelly toilet and the noise disturbances from the adjacent bar and neighboring room made my experience at this hotel far from satisfactory.",feedback
Hotel Calmo Bugis,1,Simon Lilly,"Avoid avoid avoidâ€¦.

I would not recommend you even think of booking this place. The pictures on the website do look good,  but when we arrived, the experience was something else

The room is not big at all, way too small for 4 people - and was really noisy - the windows didnâ€™t shut properly, they let lots of street noise in.

The room was Hot and took an hour to cool down. Very unpleasant.

The bed was hard and the pillows not comfortable at all.

There was no hot water from the shower in the morning.

Avoid.",feedback
Hotel Calmo Bugis,5,Marc Ivan Lanuza,"The hotel was very easy to find.

If youâ€™re coming from Changi, just take the Green Line to Bugis station.

Remember to take Exit D. Although you can take Exit A near Bugis Junction, but thats a 10minute walk. Taking Exit D is only 3 minutes.

Check-in was fast and easy. Just remember to get SGD first since thereâ€™s a 100$ deposit. Theyâ€™ll give you a receipt. Keep it so you can get the deposit back.

Evevator was a bit confusing. Just make sure to tap your access card before pressing the floor, and not the other way around.

When we entered the room, it was spacious. Industrial design. Can easily lay 3 open luggages. Theres also a water heater, iron, hairblower, and iron rack, TV, mini fridge, and AC unit.

In the shower, there was hot and cold water for both the shower and sink.

TAKE NOTE, THEREâ€™S A BIDET! â€” not all hotel in SG have a Bidet. Only a handful actually. And Hotel Calmo Bugis is one of them.

The alley adjacent to the hotel are all food stalls so no need to worry about food. Theres also a convenience store at the other end. Bugis junction and Alberts Hawker are just a few minutes away if you want to save on money for food, or buy souvenirs.

Location overall was great since most places you need to visit in SG are either in the blue or green line, and Bugis intersects both of them.",feedback

Hotel Calmo Bugis,2,Royals Capital,"When We stay here on Saturday, it was pleasant.
The room is not that big as like other Singapore budget hotel. Itâ€™s like an apartment studio. Thereâ€™s microwave and pantry on the 2nd floor. The location is quite strategic, lots of resto bars and shopping centre around the area. The hot water, wifi are good. The TV channel isnâ€™t good, only 4 channel works and most channel are blinking. I will give it 4 stars.

Yet, when We come back to the hotel 4 days after that, the reception girl accused Us that we broke the toilet cups and We must pay for $20. Offcourse We donâ€™t want to pay as they have no prove that We broke it 4 days ago. We already put $100 deposit for each room, and when We check out 4 days before the reception said everything is good. This is the first time We had an experience like this.
What happen if We didnâ€™t come back to that Hotel, how are you going to charge us?

The reception said She called her boss, by the way she doesnâ€™t called in front of us. She then come back and said the boss will waive the broken cups and if itâ€™s happen again they will charge Us for $100. When we check out, the reception check our rooms and we offer to check it together, but she doesnâ€™t want as she said it was the procedure.

Hey boss, if you read this you better learn about hotel management and customer satisfactions. If you argue to your customer, even though you win, yet you still lose the customer.

For other customer that want to stay in this hotel, make sure you make a unboxing room video, as they might accuse you broke something and take advantages. Another tips, ask to get new linen and pillow case, as Iâ€™m sure they didnâ€™t change to a new one when the customer before you check out. We stay here 2 times and booked 3 rooms, and all the linen and pillow case stinks. Do you itâ€™s a coincident? We donâ€™t think so.",feedback
Hotel Calmo Bugis,1,kristen sison,"Everything was extremely terrible except for the location of the hotel. The room was very worn out, small (lied on pictures and booking) and a lot of the furniture and bathroom tools were broken. All the bed and bathroom related things (pillows, linens, covers, sheets, towels) were all soiled and so worn out from previous guests you can see various stains and chipping or breaking. When we asked for room cleaning and replacement of pillow cases and bed linens and towels, we were only given pillow cases and towels as they were having issues with their external laundry service and the housekeepers donâ€™t clean the rooms at all even though theyâ€™re supposed to be cleaning all rooms at 5pm. As the front desk staff also seemed troubled by their housekeepers, we would be the ones going to the front desk everytime we needed new towels, tissue paper and water even though housekeeping should be doing it. Everytime we entered our room again everything was exactly the same, they couldnâ€™t even just sweep the floors as the bare minimum. It also felt really disgusting because you can smell the body odor from the beds and pillows. Their sofa bed is also not a sofa bed at all but just a regular sofa which they cover with a dirty bed sheet thatâ€™s not for the size of the sofa at all. We found various broken things like the lamp, bidet, and plugs which you have to prove that you werenâ€™t the one who caused the previous damage, so be wary and report it to them immediately. Although the location is very good as itâ€™s one of the streets of bugis and thereâ€™s a lot of food nearby, itâ€™s not worth it considering how unacceptable the quality of their rooms and service are. They also have a cash back service where giving them a fake good review would get you back some moneyâ€¦",feedback

And the hotel is not cheap, its not money worth it at all.

You need to tell the receptionist if you want your room to be cleaned. No telephone at room, since this is important actually if we need something or to contact the receptionist.

The receptionist are not friendly at all, rude, no smile, not even greetings you. If you ask questions or request something, they will reply like you are stupid and its like you never stayed in a hotel before.

What we like only the bathroom that is quite spacious, cleanliness just average ( we found some hairs on the bed)

Location is good, but againâ€¦ location good, service is bad, especially the receptionist who should be the one who most friendly and helpful in the hotel were very disappointed.

I'm not sure about the food, because mine never came.
The drink is ok, slightly on the sweeter side.

Arrived and was given the menu quite promptly, but heck, a delusion of ""good service""
It's more like pressing you to order something which, might not come.

Ordered some pratas through a male staff around 11.30 am.

30 mins later, I called him over to checked the status of my order, to which he seemed confused. He repeated my order, and I saw him walking over to another female staff gesturing towards me.

Another 30 mins passed, and my food is still not served, I called the staff over again to check on my order to which he told me ""coming soon"" while going over to inform the kitchen.

Well, another 45 mins went by and my food shows no signs of arriving.

I paid for my drink and left. Never gonna be back again.

Conclusion:
Regardless of peak or non-peak, their service standard is the same.
Price wise, definitely not worth it considering you will be paying for Service that is rather non-existent.",feedback
Srisun Express - Hougang Ave 8,5,amethyst x,"i understand that this outlet is recently opened and when there's a new outlet, things tend to get a little messy. there was a little incident that happened this evening while i was waiting for my takeaway order, another patron accidentally took portions of my order away and left. when i approached the staff for help, i was really surprised by how approachable and patient the staff was (didnt ask for her name but she is a short and plump lady) she took the effort to check the order on her side and actually remembered to get back to me (i am pleasantly surprised by her responsiveness and how communicative she was). it's not just her who has good service, my family members also agreed that all the staff seemed to be super friendly, polite and helpful. these days its really hard to find such decent customer service and all these really adds on to the positive experience i have at this new outlet. the food is yummy and the price is very reasonable. my family and i enjoyed our dinner experience over here and i'd definitely come back for the great food and friendly staff.",feedback
Srisun Express - Hougang Ave 8,1,mik sin,"Very worst service, I encountered the order out of stock and I already make payment online. The staff advised me to change the order and will refund me the difference. Once I finished the meal I ask about the refund then she said better to get a drink instead of refund due to online payment difficult to cash refund. I had waited for 30mins for my sugar cane drinks. Until I went to the counter and check, they havenâ€™t make my drinks. I was very angry on the spot and the staff turn the story said can refund by cash, I didnâ€™t accept it and leave the Shop. Very bad experience. The staff attitude like what they are selling â€œprataâ€",feedback

Srisun Express - Hougang Ave 8,1,Umamageshwary V Sukumaran,"I went there for lunch and I regretted it. First their ordering system is via qr code scanning. That's fine but the system was really slow. Plus the payment option it auto captured pay by cash. So I was assuming we will pay once we finished eating, hence we were waiting for food but after so long, the waiter came and told us we had to pay 1st, fine n we paid. We had to wait so long for the food to arrive. Best part naan came plain, no curry. They just put and went. We had to call n ask. They said naan don't come with curry. OK fine as well and we asked them where are the ala carte we ordered, again it was checking here and there. Finally it came. $7 mutton was just half of my palm size. The place is over price and over hyped. The chicken rice soup was full of msg. It was so salty, my kid struggled to eat. Lesson learned, never going there again. The serangoon outlet food is wayyyy better.",feedback

Srisun Express - Hougang Ave 8,3,Mousey Yeoh,"Needed to scan QR code to go to an app to order. Whoever released an unrefined app to be used for ordering should be excuted, the app was buggy and not very user friendly. After ordering through the app you have to make payment at the counter. Waited around 20 minutes before i asked about my order and one of the staff said it was not ready yet. Waited another 10 minutes to ask another staff and still it was not ready. Another 5 minutes in the 2nd  staff asked for my receipt to check on it. That is when i saw my order being prepared. Took another 10 minutes for the food to arrive.

Kazokutei,3,Andrew Chwee,"The service is swift, but the menu is slightly complicated. Hard the pork kimchi udon, and it is alright, nothing much to shout about. It came in a big bowl, and we were shocked, but itâ€™s not a lot for one person.",feedback
Kazokutei,2,Say Kiat Tan,"Chicken omu rice is $11.90.

Pork omu rice is $12.90.

Combo (chicken and pork) omu rice is $13.90.

So you would expect combo to be chicken omu rice and then add some pieces of pork or vice versaâ€¦ (refer to photo).

Wait until you see the waiter serving another table their chicken-only or pork-only omu rice! The portion is much much more than what you get with the more expensive combo!

So skip combo if you have the same logical mind like mine!

Disgusted so todayâ€™s visit will be my last there.",rant
Kazokutei,1,Zack Tan,"Food was so-so. But given the price you pay for it, I can close an eye.

Service and hygiene leaves a tremendous lot to be desired though. Throughout my meal, there was a huge bug flying around and the waiters did not notice it. Fair enough, given that they don't walk around the restaurant much as orders are made via iPads chained to the tables and all they do is bring food to you.

I alerted a waitress to the insect who looked at it, smiled, then walked away without even giving an apology, let alone attempt to get rid of the pest.

My order was the promotional Mentaiko cream udon with California Maki. The mentaiko was bland and the egg served with the udon (which wasn't even the typical runny type normally served with ramen/udon) was cold and unappetizing. Maki was just average. All this set me back by $15.90.

There are at least 2 other Japanese eateries including the restaurant chain Sakae Sushi nearby, if you crave the cuisine. This place is not worthwhile; give your business elsewhere.",feedback

The seafood tomyum udon had some small prawns in it, but a grand total of ONE clam SHELL. Without even any clam in it. And the tempura maki looked so sus we didn't even take a photo of it.

Not only was the wait around 45 minutes, the food did not taste appetising at all. The portion was 50% fries with 2 pieces of fried chicken balls which were rock hard and 3 pieces of pork cutlet. I am pretty sure the fried chicken balls and pork cutlet were frozen food that was microwaved. The curry was watery and diluted and did not taste like curry.

Universal Studios Singapore,5,Dharven Panchal,"Dreamy location if you are in Singapore, a must-visit place. A fun, enjoyable, and exciting day you are going to experience here if you are visiting. One full day is required here.

You have to buy passes in advance. Also, if you can install their application and check the wait time for each activity. For kids, adults, they have a Range of activities. They have introduced Minion Land and kids just love this.

The best ride is Transformers and The Mummy. They also have food stalls available. The Jurassic Park ride is just awesome. Pls bring a raincoat if you are planning for the Jurassic Park ride. Express pass is not required if you are visiting jn off off-season. On Sunday, they have parade.",feedback

Our children especially loved the themed rides and character meet-and-greets â€” seeing their favorite movie characters come to life was a real highlight! The staff were friendly, helpful, and made sure everything ran smoothly.

We also appreciated the shaded areas and rest spots, which made it easy to take breaks throughout the day. There were plenty of food options, and the park was very family-friendly overall.

Highly recommended for families looking to spend a fun-filled day together. Weâ€™ll definitely be coming back again!",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,1,Prathi Pranav,"Very very poor management! Didn't expect this kind of response from one of the best world class entertainment park!

Here's the scene-

We visited on a weekday and still wait time for main rides were almost 120mins (2hours), meaning we cannot take more than 3 rides. After spending lot of money and not able to use all the rides is like total waste.

No benefits even on express pass.

Plus some rides come into maintenance, so if someone waited for 1hr but cannot complete the ride. (No ride + time wasted).

Ad- Rides are super awesome , lot of fun.

These are must-
1. Transformers
2. 2 roller coasters
3. Jurassic park
4. Canopy flyer",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,5,Eugene T,We visited on a weekday and not during the holidays or school breaks. It was fairly quiet except for a group of overseas travellers. You can buy the express ticket but only make that selection once you are there and confirm it will be busy. Take your time and spend the full day there so youâ€™re not rushing around. Bring small backpack in case you have to store it during some rides and remember your water and umbrella. There are rides for all ages so lots to go round for everyone and heaps of souvenirs to buy at every sections.,feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,5,Kevin Chavez,"What an amazing theme park. Universal Singapore may be small, but it has so much packed within it.

Universal Studios Singapore,4,Sello,"It was a great experience to visit the resort during the week. The resort was less crowded, which was a pleasant surprise.

Universal Studios Singapore,5,Deepak Pant,Nice experience with family. Needs a full day to explore the park. Be prepared for long waiting times sometimes up to 2 hours for a single ride. Buy the express pass if you can afford it. Food is good and reasonably priced compared to other such theme parks. We liked the one in Oasis cafe in the Egyptian section.,feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,5,ChuLuxe Explorer,"Universal Studios Singapore is a true playground of happiness. Itâ€™s definitely not just for kids. Adults can have a great time too. There are so many fun and exciting rides, but honestly, some were a bit too intense for me. Anything that flips you upside down was a no from me. I preferred just walking around, soaking in the atmosphere, which felt perfect for my pace and age.

One thing to keep in mind is the waiting time. I had to wait almost an hour for some rides. It gets really crowded, especially later in the day. If you want to make the most of your visit, I highly recommend getting the Fast Track pass. It saves you a lot of time and stress. Also, come early if you can. That really helps.",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,5,Aurelien Ducos,"We spent a day that we will never forget! Universal Studios Singapore was simply incredibleâ€”undoubtedly one of the best activities to enjoy as a family. The park is full of thrilling rides, immersive worlds, and fun for all ages.

If you can afford it, I highly recommend purchasing the Express Passes. They allow you to skip the regular queuesâ€”which can be 45 to 60 minutes longâ€”and go straight to the rides. It made a huge difference to our experience and let us enjoy so much more of the park without wasting time in line.

A must-do while in Singapore!",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,5,Vipin Nair,"The tickets are expensive but itâ€™s worth it. And you require a full day of enjoy all the things to see and go on different rides. With small kids, it may be difficult as many rides are only for taller people, but there is plenty of things for kids as well. Though we went on a weekday, most rides had minimum waiting period of 30-40 minutes. But except the rides; lots of fun activities to do, but rides are a big draw.",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,5,MonoBattery,My first time going USS! The queue was long but it was fast and basically you can do a circle of the place. I rode the Sesame Street's and Revenge of the Mummy's ride. After that mostly took photos because I cannot handle motion sickness. There were restrooms and snacks/drinks placed all around so no fret. Lockers are provided when you need to go on rides that doesn't allow bags/cameras. Check out the shops too!,feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,5,Dward Sealmoy Jr.,One the highlights of our Singapore tour. Clean and afforable. Will definitely comeback.

Universal Studios Singapore,5,Shanuka Rathnayake,"I visited Universal Studios Singapore back in 2018, and itâ€™s still one of my favorite travel memories! From the moment I walked in, the atmosphere was full of excitement and adventure. Each themed zone was so creative and well-designed, it truly felt like stepping into different movie worlds.

The rides were amazing! I especially loved the Transformers ride and the Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure. There was something for everyone, whether you enjoy thrilling roller coasters or more relaxed family, friendly attractions.

The park was clean, well-organized, and the staff were friendly and helpful. There were also plenty of places to grab a quick snack or meal, and even the food felt like part of the experience.

Universal Studios Singapore,3,Carmelo Distefano,"I had more fun than expected however we paid over AUD 1000 for three kids limited express tickets and two adult entry passes and there were a number of rides closed for maintenance, particularly the Lost World ride which was the only one I was interested in.

Overall though the staff were friendly and welcoming and the family had a good time.",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,3,Nur Athirah Binte Hussain,"Plan your trip. We went on a Sunday and had to wait at least 45 minutes for each ride. Food was expensive so make sure you guys bring some snacks to sustain during the time in the theme park.

Universal Studios Singapore,2,-Obydur Rahman Shazol-,"A very good Theme Park to bring your kids.
However authority should take necessary measures to limit the number of guests inside the Studio as currently you have to wait 45-120 minutes just for a 2/3 minutes ride.
As a result people can not enjoy all the ride and can not roam around the park freely.",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,4,Madhuram Sabari,"Universal Studios Singapore was a fun and exciting experience overall. The park is beautifully designed, giving off Disney-like vibes with well-crafted zones, characters, and attractions that are immersive and entertaining.

Every attraction I tried was enjoyable â€” from thrilling rides to themed shows, thereâ€™s something for all age groups. The setups and attention to detail are impressive, making it feel like youâ€™ve stepped into a movie world.

That said, the place is a bit on the expensive side, and one downside was the cloakroom/luggage storage charges, which felt too high for a theme park. (I donâ€™t remember the exact price, but it was more than expected for a few hours of storage.)

Despite that, if youâ€™re in Singapore and up for a full-day adventure, itâ€™s definitely worth visiting once. Just plan your time and budget accordingly!",feedback

Luckily I order/asked for no spring onions if not worse the housefly will be hidden mix up ...
Totally making us to puke after seeing it and no more appetite to continue eating both .. Really can't believe a dead housefly can' be served on the curry udon to us..

Kazokutei,3,Zhi Heng,"Food is decent but nothing spectacular or worth travelling for especially cause its on the pricey side. The tempura r decent but have this taste of reused oil. the sweet potato tempura can be softer in texture. N the sauce is too watery n lacking in flavour in my opinion. I had the asari udon which was decent too just that it's a tad too salty for my liking. Serving size was kinda small, wasnt fu after eating. N it would be better if there r more ingredients n garnishes present to make it more aesthetically pleasing and flavourful considering the price. Place is relatively empty even during dinner time. Good thing is that water is provided free of charge tho i feel that a standard drink like hoji tea should have been included in the set meal like most places. Food is decent just that for that price range I would expect much more.

To my horror, he shouted across the restaurant ""can you call my other colleagues"" as he does some kind of hand movement to indicate as if ""can't you see I'm already very busy why are you calling me over"".

I felt attacked as a customer and felt disgusted when we had him as our cashier and had to give our hard-earned money to pay for such a service. Maybe he had a bad day, and I can empathize with that.

Kazokutei,1,Leon Han,"Worse table experience. Was served by the so called server lead, when we requested for more tonkatsu sauce, she actually told us "" this is the 3rd time, no more"". Like come on is just sauce, didn't expect to be so calculative.

Servers were not active in filling up tea and take a more reactive then proactive service (always have to request for refills)

Lastly the server lead was like raising her voice to another staff of hers about the work and the entire half of the outlet could hear her. Not professional one bit and cause so much unpleasantries while dining.

To be fair the food was ok but don't expect basic service there and save your 10% service charge on something else. Experience was bad. So not recommended.",feedback
Kazokutei,3,Jucci,"No queue here despite the dinner rush. Food was OK, did take a while to arrive but it was a good crowd. Service staff placed us on the wrong table that was meant to be reserved and had to ask us to move to another table. Lucky for them we had not ordered our food yet. Slight inconvenience.",feedback
Kazokutei,1,Edwin Lee,"No floor staffs.
I can confirm that the chef donâ€™t even know what is omu rice. Ordered omu chicken set, more like a NTUC chicken chunks with normal fried egg rice. No fragrance to the rice. Totally not what they adv outside the shop. $$$ Wasted and definitely a meal.",feedback
Kazokutei,2,ZL Choo,"Food quality wise almost like school canteen for about 20$ per pax est. Service is poor, filled with uncommitted part timer. Food wait time is long also. The only saving grace is no queue and your only option during peak hours. I would go for even fastfood anytime if it wasnt for the queue.",feedback

Kazokutei,2,Darrell Lye,"I was amazed at how pedestrian the food was. Forgettable and uninspired. I wish we walked past and went to a different eatery.

Omu curry rice is hard to screw up, this was just passable. The wappu gozen was mushy and not tasty. The zaru soba was of poor quality. Even the wasabi served with it was tasteless. The tempura was not crispy. The hot tea was not good either.

The only upside....the pudding was quite good.",feedback
Kazokutei,1,gladyn w,Such a horrible place to eat. The Tom yam udon tastes like maggi powder. And seafood was  not fresh and overcooked. The fries are soggy and stale. The fried chicken tastes like oil that has been reused a thousand times. Avoid this place at all costs!!!!!,feedback
Kazokutei,1,Grace Lim,Waited for more than half and hour and my food was still not served. Ordered udon. Like you can't cook udon in 30mins??!!  Service is terrible. Customers are raising their hands but no one attends to us.  Ended up leaving because it was just so bad. Ended up with gastric for waiting too long.,rant
Kazokutei,1,Vivien COTIER,"I had a very bad experience. Food is decent in taste but too expensive for the portion and what it is, fries were not cooked

I would not recommend if you are looking for a restaurant in Bugis.",feedback

Kazokutei,1,Jolin Lau,"1. the customer service was so bad as werenâ€™t even that much customers in the restaurant when i came. the waiters did not even gave us attention when i called out for them.
2. when the food came, the fried chicken was raw and uncooked inside. not only my food , my friends and i all had uncooked chicken. i told this to the waiter and they insisted that it was supposed to be like this. however, my friends and i were all food science students thus, we knew clearly the difference between cooked and uncooked chicken.
in the end, im glad they gave us a refund when we asked for it however, if i wouldâ€™ve gave a zero stars instead.
my friends and i came here ard 6pm on 21st june",feedback
Kazokutei,1,Sofia Ng,"Came here 21/6, about 6pm, at bugis Junction.

Place was vacant with only one other customer. My friend and I ordered an omurice, the chicken was obviously pink and uncooked.

Tried to bring attention to waiter, but no one came until I got up to look for someone. Waiter brought it to kitchen but they insisted the pink was natural.

Opened the next piece of chicken to see it was white and pink inside. My friend's omurice chicken one of the pieces were still frozen.

Finally, the waitress brought it back and the manager allowed us to have a refund. None of the staff were particularly apologetic, and no compensation was given.

Uncooked food and terrible customer service.

Would give zero stars but not possible.",feedback
Kazokutei,1,Zack Tan,"Quality service from Jie Yi. From the moment she brought us from the counter to the table, no greeting, no acknowledgement, not a single word uttered. Just chucking the menu to us then slamming the tablets (2 which we had were defective).

Wafu is essentially like steamed rice in a bamboo basket with some ingredients in it like chicken or seafood. It was a bit disappointing to be honest -- I ordered the chicken wafu and it wasn't very flavorful and didn't come out very hot. Overall just not really satisfying. I also got the fried chicken to go with it, and it wasn't super crispy or hot. It was just...there. The best part of this set was actually the chawanmushi! It was really smooth and silky.

Newton Food Centre,4,OceanSevens,"A little ways from Orchard Rd is Newtown Hawker Centre. I needed to try hawker street style and certainly Singapore is one of the places to try.

Many kiosk fill up the compound and from the crosssing bridge, one can smell the aroma of the satays, stir friend noodles, fresh seafood on the grill.  Upon arrival, there will be several hawkers from calling out to you, waving the gigantic menus whilst the eyes scan the place for the available seats.

After 15 mins of circling the entire food centre, we settled into Newtown 51 - pretty much wok cooked, Chinese concept meals. We order char stir friend noodles, crispy omelet dish and turnip wok-cooked, I was refused the sale of plain steamed rice from the place and next door restaurant which was bizarre and moreso a rude, flat out refusal to sell rice because we did not dine with them.

The food, overall was good. tasty, quickly cooked and price is reasonable for the price and the costs of easy dining in SG. The highlight was the drinks which were reasonable.

All in all, I would return again for the buzzing energy of the food stalls and the masses of people they cater to but it would have been more of positive if the locals there were friendlier. But then again, they must be dealing with tourists from all walks of life and franking smiles constantly could be tiresome.  BUT again - you represent your country to be friendly! : )",feedback
Newton Food Centre,4,Takahiro Koyama,"This popular open-air hawker center has major tropical vibesâ€”surrounded by tall palm trees and full of open seating, it's super laid-back and breezy. Food stalls are set up in a big circle around the tables, creating a fun, social atmosphere.

Thereâ€™s a huge variety of food hereâ€”everything from Singaporean classics to Chinese, Malay, Indian, Thai, and even Western dishes. You'll also find stalls for drinks, fresh fruit, and desserts.

Some places serve fancy stuff like chili crab, pepper crab, lobster, and other premium seafood, but the real crowd-pleasers are the local faves like satay, chicken wings, oyster omelets, chicken rice, prawn mee, and carrot cake.

Itâ€™s a go-to late-night spot tooâ€”many stalls stay open past 1 AM, and it gets especially lively on weekends!

I liked all the dishes, but my favorites were the stingray with sambal, carrot cake and deep fried glazed sqiud (?). Delicious flavors and interesting textures all around. If I lived in Singapore, I'd certainly be eating out at hawker centers all the time.
To the surprise of no one, there was a lot leftovers, but they were nice enough to pack everything to go.",feedback
Newton Food Centre,4,Ada K,"Newton Food Centre offers a really enjoyable hawker experience â€” itâ€™s clean, well-maintained, and has a great buzz without feeling too hectic. Compared to some other hawker centres around Singapore, itâ€™s definitely more comfortable. While itâ€™s not exactly â€œhigh-end,â€ it does feel a little more curated. The fans keep the space surprisingly cool despite it being open-air, and even the toilets were moderately acceptable â€” which is always a bonus at these types of places!

The food was delicious overall, though you do see a bit of repetition across the stalls. That said, there are some real gems if you know what to look for. The fishball soup was a standout â€” fresh, flavourful, and comforting. And one particular stall, which boasts a Michelin star and a few celebrity fans, serves fantastic skewers and chicken wings that are absolutely worth trying.

Definitely a must-visit if you want a lively hawker experience with a bit more breathing room. Great for casual dinners with friends or visitors looking for a taste of local food in a slightly more relaxed setting.",feedback

Newton Food Centre,5,Foodieextreme Foodieextreme,"We came to Newton Food Centre twice during our trip and had two very different but equally great experiences. The first time, everyone in my family was exhausted so we kept it simple and got satay from Awesome Bbq Chicken Wing and Satay. It was just what we needed.

On our second visit, my husband generously gave me \$50 to spend however I likedâ€”and I spent it all on one amazing Singapore chili crab from a stall called Awesome Always. It cost exactly \$50 and I have no regrets. We got satay again from Awesome Bbq Chicken Wing and Satay because my kids absolutely loved it.

We also had calamansi juice (listed as lime juice) and iced lychee from Thong Lai Cold Drinks and Beer, which were super refreshing. And we tried oyster omelette and carrot cake from Tanglinâ€”both were delicious.

Newton has such a fun, lively vibe and tons of great food. Itâ€™s definitely a spot to come hungry and sample a bit of everything.",feedback

Newton Food Centre,4,Simon Liang,"Made famous by the movie ""Crazy Rich Asians"", Newton Food Centre is every bit the quintessential food centre dining experience whilst in Singapore.
I'm a sucker for CKT and this place has some of the cheapest & best CKT around.
The hygiene is not always the best (but that can be said for almost every food centre in Singapore) and it can be quite difficult to find a table to sit at, especially during the peak lunch & dinner times.
So long as you can get past all the shop vendors that try to solicit you to buy their food, as well as all the uncles & aunties that try to sell you tissues or antiseptic wipes at an inflated price, it's an amazing dining experience, with a diverse range of food & drinks for you to purchase.",feedback

He followed us all the way to our tables and tried to quickly find us a seat so we can quickly order from his stall. He helped us wipe the tables and chairs as it wet even tho we never ask him to but we thanked him after. We sat down thinking what to eat but he came to our table 4-5 times asking if we want to order. We wanted more time so that we can look around at other hawkers because theres just so many food. When we didn't order yet, he came to our table and quickly grab his menu and walked off without justifying the reason AND we were about to order from his stall. How rude!! Eventually, my friend went up to him and ordered sambal stingray, white bee hoon, mantou and bbq king prawn. Food was so-so only but doesn't justify his earlier actions.

Newton Food Centre,5,Michael Connor,"Review: My Incredible Experience at Newton Food Centre, Singapore

Singapore is a paradise for food lovers, and Newton Food Centre is an absolute gem for anyone looking to experience the cityâ€™s famous hawker culture. I had the pleasure of visiting this bustling food haven, and my experience was nothing short of spectacular.

A Culinary Delight: Oyster Omelette

One of the highlights of my visit was indulging in a plate of oyster omelette, a beloved Singaporean dish. The dish was a perfect blend of crispy, golden-brown egg batter and plump, juicy oysters, garnished with fresh cilantro and served with a side of spicy chili sauce. The balance of flavorsâ€”savory, slightly briny from the oysters, and the fiery kick from the sauceâ€”was absolutely divine. Every bite was a delight, especially with the contrast of the crispy edges and the softer, eggy portions. The bustling energy of the hawker stalls, with vendors shouting out orders and the sizzling sounds from the woks, only added to the charm of the meal.

A Vibrant Performance: Lion and Dragon Dance

As if the food wasnâ€™t exciting enough, I was lucky to witness a traditional lion and dragon dance performance at the food centre! The vibrant orange lion heads, with their bold eyes and intricate designs, were lined up in preparation for the show. Behind them, the enormous golden dragon coiled majestically, ready to come to life. The air filled with rhythmic drum beats, the clash of cymbals, and the deep, resonant gongs as the performers brought the lions and dragon to life.

The performance was electrifyingâ€”watching the dancers maneuver the lion heads with such precision and energy was mesmerizing. The dragon slithered and weaved through the crowd, its golden scales shimmering under the bright hawker center lights. The atmosphere was festive, and the crowd was completely captivated, cheering and taking videos of the thrilling spectacle. It was an unforgettable moment that perfectly encapsulated Singaporeâ€™s rich cultural heritage.

The Hawker Experience

Newton Food Centre itself is an experience worth having. The neon-lit beverage stalls, the variety of drinks from fresh sugarcane juice to ice-cold beer, and the energetic hawkers calling out orders make it a lively and exciting spot. The blend of flavors, the sounds of sizzling woks, and the aroma of grilled seafood fill the air, making it a paradise for food lovers.

Final Thoughts

My visit to Newton Food Centre was unforgettableâ€”a perfect mix of delicious food and vibrant cultural performances. The oyster omelette was delicious, the dragon dance was exhilarating, and the entire atmosphere was buzzing with energy. Whether youâ€™re a foodie or just looking for an authentic Singaporean experience, this hawker center is a must-visit. Iâ€™ll definitely be coming back for more!",feedback
Newton Food Centre,5,Bianca Camille Co,"I always visit this place for food. Enjoyed their Indian Butter Chicken, Chicken Wings, Satay, Oyster Omelette (Very crispy!) and of course their Milo Dino. Itâ€™s good to be back.",feedback
Newton Food Centre,5,JuthaMars C,"Real foodcourt of Singapore.
I take Chili crab and Black pepper crab. It were superb.",feedback
Newton Food Centre,3,Daniel,"We visited Newton because it was the closest to our hotel and one of the few places open late when we arrived. We got the Sambal Stingray and Seafood Kway Teow. The Stingray was unique and delicious enough, although probably too spicy for a late night meal. The Kway Teow was generously portioned, but there wasn't much seafood, and the prawns didn't taste fresh.

Despite prohibition, most of the hawker stall owners engage in hawking, trying to pressure you to sit down and order from them, which was off-putting.

Definitely the most tourist trap hawker centre â€“ I would avoid it.",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,5,Siu Bernice,"We were there on a weekday, non Sg public holiday from 10am till 5pm. We bought our tickets from Klook. Entry was easy. No bag check or whatsoever.

We enjoyed the day there. We managed to go on some 8/9 rides. Some rides needed a longer time to queue but its bearable !

Staffs there are friendly and approachable. They helped us to take photos willingly. There are many water dispenser around for refills. Toilets are clean as well !

Great day under the sun   ! Thanks for the memories!",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,5,Logesh Kumar,"We have visited Universal Studios Singapore last Sunday, had an exciting and memorable experience. The park is easily accessible by various means of transportation, including walking, cable car, bus, metro, car and taxi, making it very convenient to reach.

Despite the large crowds throughout the day, the overall experience was enjoyable. Many visitors began entering the park right at opening time, and most of the popular rides had wait times ranging from 60 to 90 minutes. While the rides themselves are relatively short typically lasting between 60 to 120 seconds they are absolutely worth the wait and deliver a thrilling experience.

For certain rides, bags are not permitted; however, complimentary lockers are available for up to 90 minutes, which is a very practical feature. The park is well-organized, with easy access to restrooms and a wide variety of restaurants. One full day is likely not enough to explore all the rides, attractions, and live events, so planning a longer visit is recommended.

There are also hotels offering the convenience of staying close to the park for those who wish to explore more thoroughly. The park is suitable for all age groups, although itâ€™s important to note that many rides have height restrictions.",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,5,Vijayakumar Jayabal,"We visited on 15may2025. A must visit for kids with family. All rides are interesting though some are kids friendly and suitable for all ages. This park is very well maintained and staffs are friendly.
Starting from stage dance to thrilling roller coaster rides are available to cherish.
Be there sharp at 10am when this amusement park opens sothat you can cover all rides & shows. Reaching this venue is very easy. After parking underground, just an escalator away to enter into. Prior booking is helpful to avoid the ticket queue. Also, cable and mono train available to reach from mainland. We came by bus.
Take a quick photo in front of the globe and enter it by scanning tickets. We straightaway rush into Jurassic park which is located in the last end. There is no crowd so we did all rides over there. Then we covered one by one throughout the day. Don't miss Jurassic park rapid adventures, Transformer ride, Minion 3d experience, newyork hurricane show, sesame ride, hollywood stage drama theater and other rides...Early morning and closing hours of 5pm around, almost all rides are less crowded and we cover more.

Food is costlier but no other choice. If you are lucky , you can take it inside your own snacks and drinks.
We skipped buying branded souvenirs, very much costlier.
So, one full day is needed. Be prepared for the rain but easily manageable due to closer proximity of each ride. Last but not least, at 600pm, there is a realistic Dinosaur parade show in vehicle at Jurassic park venue. Don't miss it!",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,5,Moza Alqaydi,"I had a fantastic time visiting this amusement park! The entrance ticket was reasonably priced, and the overall cost was very affordable for the fun we had.

The rides were absolutely amazingâ€”exciting, safe, and suitable for all ages. There was a great variety, from thrilling roller coasters to fun attractions for kids. The park was clean, well-organized, and the staff were friendly and helpful.

Universal Studios Singapore,5,Asheesh Gupta,"Have fun.
Download their APP to view the waiting time at each ride in real time. It is really accurate.
The queues are considerably smaller by the last hour of the day. It could be a good idea to try the rides again in the end.

I found most of the open shows were not worth it. Could be relevant for the kids.",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,5,Param Shendekar,"The Universal Studios is a must-visit place when you are in Singapore. We experienced 2 Roller Coasters.

Universal Studios Singapore,3,Tiya,"Not my 1st time here, probably my 3rd-4th time here but heard that they recently opened â€œMinion landâ€. So, i was kind of expecting lots of new layouts and attractions. Nothing changed much apart from the minion land.

The newly opened â€œminion landâ€ is cute and all. But nothing much in terms of merchandise and attractions. They only have the same â€œMinions Mayhemâ€ as the one they have in Osaka. The queue was insanely long! (I decided to gave up).

Went there on Monday, there is no queue for the entrance. The size of the park is relatively small comparing the other Universal Studio. However, it could be a pro/con. The pro is itâ€™s very easy to walk around i spent only 2-3hrs to finished the whole park.
The con is thereâ€™s nothing much to be honest.

Went there on late July, the weather is insane hot , just be mindful of that too!",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,5,Aidan Cusa,"Was so fun I visited twice. However, thereâ€™s really only enough stuff to do for one day.

If you have the money, itâ€™s worth it to splurge on the fast pass you go like straight to the front of the line every time cause very few other people also have the fast pass (at least in Mid July). If you donâ€™t buy it, go to the park right when it opens so you donâ€™t have to wait in the crazy long queues.

Minion land was my favorite location and the cyclone my favorite ride. The trolls concert was pretty fun to watch too. Food was delicious too!",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,4,Yada Samnakphong,"Great experience! The rides are fun and exciting, but the lines are long (even on Monday) and no a/c, be prepared to stand in the heat.

Universal Studios Singapore,5,Thusitha Kariyawasam,"A magical experience at Universal Studios Singapore! We had an unforgettable day, especially with our 4-year-old son.

From the moment we entered, we were immersed in the world of beloved movies and characters. The park is incredibly well maintained, and the staff were friendly and welcoming, making our experience smooth and enjoyable.

The rides were suitable for all ages, and my son had an absolute blast. He loved the Sesame Street characters, especially meeting Elmo and Big Bird, which was a dream come true for him. We also enjoyed the interactive play areas that were perfect for his age. The Jurassic Park area was another highlight, with exciting attractions that were thrilling for both adults and children. Although some of the larger rides might have been a bit too intense for younger kids, there were plenty of milder attractions like the Madagascar ride, which was a great fit for our little one.

What really stood out was how family-friendly the park is. There are many child-friendly facilities, including spacious baby changing rooms and stroller rentals, which made it so convenient for us as parents. The food options were diverse, catering to all tastes and dietary preferences.

The highlight of the day was the parades and shows, which kept my son entertained with vibrant costumes, music, and performances. Even if youâ€™re not a huge theme park fan, Universal Studios Singapore offers a full day of fun for the whole family.",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,5,Areta,"Had such a great time on my first visit!

Universal Studios Singapore,5,Ayu Indah Carolina,"Universal Studios Singapore is a dream destination for families, especially with kids! From the moment we stepped in, we were transported into the world of movies, adventure, and non-stop excitement. The park is well-organized with different themed zones like Madagascar, Far Far Away, Ancient Egypt, and Sci-Fi Cityâ€”each offering unique rides and attractions.

Our favorite part? Definitely Minion Landâ€”our little ones couldnâ€™t stop smiling! They loved the spinning rides, the character meet-and-greets, and of course, the bright yellow minions everywhere. For older kids and adults, thrilling rides like the Revenge of the Mummy and Transformers 4D were unforgettable. The shows were also top-notchâ€”fun, interactive, and a great way to take a break from the heat.

The park is very family-friendly with stroller access, clean toilets, and lots of food options (though they can be a bit pricey). We recommend arriving early to avoid long queues and to download the USS app for showtimes and waiting times.

Overall, Universal Studios Singapore gave us a magical experienceâ€”where both kids and grown-ups got to laugh, scream, and make memories together. A must-visit when youâ€™re in Singapore!",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,4,Joe Viloria,"Still a delightful experience to spend time in USS. Prices of food and basic necessities can be steep. I found great value in their drinks that come in hard plastic thought. Waiting times for rides can be very long.

The rollercoasters and other rides were incredibly fun and provided plenty of thrills â€“ I thoroughly enjoyed every single one! It's clear that safety is a top priority here, as the staff were consistently vigilant and thorough in checking the safety of all participants before each ride, which was very reassuring.

While the souvenirs were a bit on the pricier side, they were still a nice memento of the visit. Overall, the positive experience with the rides and the excellent safety measures made it a truly memorable day out.

Universal Studios Singapore,4,ankur verma,Its a technically a waiting studio if you don't have an express pass. But if you have it or you are ready to stand for one hour for a 2 minute ride then its a wonderful place to enjoy. Rides are amazing and it has everything for kids to adults,feedback

Universal Studios Singapore,4,Vishal Kamdar,"Last week, we visited Universal Studios Singapore. Weâ€™ve already been to Universal Studios in Dubai and Disneyland in Paris, but honestly, this one was the best experience of them all!

Itâ€™s a good idea to buy your tickets in advance, and if your budget allows, go for the Express Passâ€”it really helps save time and lets you skip the long queues. Also, make sure to download their mobile app before you go. The app is helpfulâ€”it shows you the waiting times for each ride and helps you find your ride easily.

We especially enjoyed ride like: Despicable Me Minion Mayhem, Shrek 4D Adventure, Magic Potion Spin, Puss in Bootsâ€™ Giant Journey, and Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure. Some of the roller coasters were also really fun!

You can bring your own food inside, but they donâ€™t allow you to eat it at the restaurants or on their tables. I think it would be nice if they had a small area for people who bring their own food.

Overall, it was a great experience and a super fun day!",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,5,Md. Raisul Islam,"Universal Studios Singapore (USS), located on Sentosa Island, is Southeast Asiaâ€™s first and only Universal Studios theme park. Opened in 2010, it offers a blend of thrilling rides, immersive shows, and family-friendly attractions across seven uniquely themed zones.

The park features over 24 rides and attractions, including popular ones like Transformers: The Ride â€“ 3D, Revenge of the Mummy, and the dueling roller coasters Battlestar Galactica: Human vs. Cylon. These rides deliver high-octane thrills, while family-friendly options like Sesame Street Spaghetti Space Chase and Puss in Boots' Giant Journey provide entertainment for younger visitors.

USS's themed zonesâ€”Hollywood, New York, Sci-Fi City, Ancient Egypt, The Lost World, Far Far Away, and Madagascarâ€”are meticulously designed to transport guests into the worlds of their favorite movies. The recent addition of Minion Land, which opened in February 2025, brings the whimsical world of Despicable Me to life with attractions like Minion Mayhem and the exclusive Buggie Boogie carousel.

For those looking to maximize their experience, the Universal Express Pass offers priority access to select attractions, helping to skip the regular queues. However, it's worth noting that not all rides are included in the Express Pass, and availability is limited, so it's advisable to plan ahead.

Dining options within the park cater to a variety of tastes, from quick bites to sit-down meals. Visitors can enjoy themed eateries that complement the immersive experience of each zone.

While USS offers a compact yet comprehensive theme park experience, some visitors have noted that it can get crowded during peak hours, especially in the afternoon. To make the most of your visit, it's recommended to arrive early, utilize the Express Pass if available, and plan your route to avoid long wait times for popular attractions.

Universal Studios Singapore,5,Ricky Zulfandi,"Just got back from an amazing day at Universal Studios Singapore with the fam â€” and wow, what a blast! From the moment we walked in, the energy was just awesome. The park is super well-organized, clean, and full of fun vibes.

We started off with the Transformers ride â€” seriously one of the coolest 3D rides Iâ€™ve ever been on. The kids were screaming (in a good way), and even the adults were hyped. Then we hit up Jurassic Park, got soaked on the river raft ride, and didnâ€™t even care because it was so much fun.

One of the highlights? The Minion Mart and all the Despicable Me stuff â€” my little cousin couldn't stop smiling. Oh, and donâ€™t miss the Revenge of the Mummy ride if you like a little thrill. Totally worth the wait!

There are plenty of food options too â€” from quick snacks to proper meals. We grabbed lunch at one of the themed diners and even found some halal choices, which was a plus for our family.

Overall, it was such a wholesome day â€” full of laughter, a bit of adrenaline, and tons of unforgettable memories. Whether you're with kids, teens, or just a bunch of fun-loving adults, Universal Studios Singapore is totally worth the trip!",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,4,Tara Christides,"This was a fun day out and something to tick off the Singapore bucket list.
We purchased tickets beforehand which I'd definitely recommend doing. We arrived about 30 mins after opening and got straight through within a couple minutes.
Also recommend you download the app for the map, show times and wait times for each ride.

Most rides had a listed wait time of between 20-70 minutes on the app, but we found all of them moved much quicker than that. We also found that wait times became less around the middle part of the day when people were having lunch, and the afternoon when a lot of families with younger kids had left for the day.

There was plenty of shade throughout the whole park and each themed section had it's own food places, pop up carts with ice cold drinks, bathrooms/toilets, water fountains and store for souvenir shopping. There was also lockers throughout so you could lock away bags if you wished while you were on rides.
The entrance/exit to the park has all themed shops so you didn't have to go back if you decided you wanted something.
Stores also deliver your purchases to a concierge at the front of the park so you don't have to carry them around all day.

Food and drink was on the pricier side but we expected this so didn't come as too much of a surprise. There was plenty of food choices with all different cuisines so there'll be something for everyone.
We spent about 5-6 hours at the park (3 adults, no kids) and only did 3 rides. We took our time checking out all the different sections and didn't rush through.

Getting there from our hotel was super easy via taxi. To get home, we went to the Resorts World specific taxi rank and it took about 5 taxis before one would take us - all the rest said our hotel was too far away (about 12 minute drive) so wouldn't accept our ride.",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,5,Dr. Sourav Mandal,"A day well spent. We entered the park around 9.55 am. Went straight to sci-fi no line for entry. Food very costly inside. If possible bring your own food. Many drinking water taps are available, only need bottle. Some rides kids below 135 cm not allowed. Use the universal studio app to track the wait time, meet and greet time and other things. Very helpful full app. Enjoy â¤ï¸",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,4,Niel J.,"Universal Studios Singapore may not be the biggest theme park, but itâ€™s packed with excitement and really well-designed. I had such a fun time exploring the different themed zonesâ€”Hollywood, Ancient Egypt, Jurassic Park, Sci-Fi City, and more. Each area is like stepping into a movie set, with detailed scenery and immersive vibes.

One of the highlights for me was the Transformers 4D rideâ€”it was thrilling, fast-paced, and the effects made it feel super real. I also really enjoyed the Jurassic Park Rapids Adventureâ€”just be prepared to get a little wet! If you prefer something more relaxing, there are plenty of family-friendly rides too, like the carousel or Sesame Street-themed attractions.

The live shows were also a nice touch. I caught a stunt performance that was surprisingly intense and well-choreographed. Plus, there are lots of chances to meet characters for photos, which adds to the fun.

My tip: go on a weekday if possible to avoid the long queues, and check the show schedule in advance so you donâ€™t miss anything.

Overall, itâ€™s a great spot for families, friends, or anyone looking for a full day of fun and adventure. Even if youâ€™re not a hardcore movie fan, youâ€™ll definitely find something to enjoy here!",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,5,Raghu Rajaram,"It was a dream come true when I visited this much awaited adventure spot.
Every ride was worth the money and each ride kept offering more and more thrills.
The highlights were the centipede roller coaster  , the Transformers ride, the Jurassic Park, the Shrek 3D show, the water world show.
If you are going on a busy day itâ€™s advisable to get the VIP pass to skip the queue or else you wonâ€™t be able to cover them all.

To make the most of your day, I'd highly recommend opting for the Express Ticket - it would've saved us so much time!

Universal Studios Singapore,4,Shanthiea Kanthan,"Went on a Tuesday and it was packed â€“ thousands of people were already lining up before opening. Queues for rides took up to 2 hours, so I only managed to try the major ones: Transformers, Human, Cylon, and The Mummy. All were amazing, with Cylon being the best.

Food-wise, Cookie Monster snack was tasty, while Shrek waffle, Melâ€™s Drive-In burger, slushie, and ice cream were decent but nothing special (and overpriced, as expected in a theme park).

Highly recommend getting the Express Pass if you want to experience all the rides without wasting hours in line.",feedback

Universal Studios Singapore,2,Sebastian ZakÅ‚ada,"First things first - it's super tiny. Compared to Orlando it's a miniature. And that's fine, not everything has to be massive, BUT... what's not tiny in Singapore though is PRICE.

It's ridiculous how expensive it is for what it was. You can walk around the whole place in 10 minutes. We were super lucky since the park was not crowded at all, frankly it was empty. Walk-ins everywhere.

Of course, no drinks from outside of the park are allowed so make sure to bring empty water bottles to fill up at the fountains. Also no outside food is allowed and there is only fast food in the park and the only place where there was enough people to form a crowd was the restaurants. But that's pretty typical of all amusement parks, which in today's times is pretty mind blowing.

Overall if you manage to snag a ticket that's 1/4 the price, maybe then it's worth going. Otherwise, avoid.",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,4,Caitlin Rajkumar,"We visited Universal Studios Singapore in July 2025 and had a fun time overall, though there were a few drawbacks. The park is noticeably smaller than Universal Orlando, so it may feel limited if youâ€™re used to bigger parks. The fast pass can only be used once per ride, which isnâ€™t great if you want to go on favorites more than once. Food lines were very long during peak hours, so itâ€™s best to eat early or late. Also, the two main roller coasters were down several times throughout the day, which was disappointing. Still, the park has great theming, exciting shows, and offers a solid day of entertainment for all ages!",feedback

Compared to the parks in Japan, the size and crowd level felt just right â€” it was easy to get around and more manageable, especially for families.

However, I was disappointed with the staffâ€™s handling at one of the attractions. We were told we could board, but once we got to the ride, there were no available seats. We were then asked if we wanted to wait for the next round or split up our group, which caused confusion. Overall, the customer service felt a bit careless.

The park itself has a lot of potential, and the location and scale are great. With improvements to staff coordination and guest service, the experience could be much better.",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,5,Venugopal Pai,Great place for kids and adults to spend an entire day in Singapore. The Minion show is the silver lining among all the shows.

Newton Food Centre,5,Melanie E,"A local brought me here. A popular centre for both locals and tourists. I was told a segment of the movie â€˜Crazy Rich Asiansâ€™ was filmed here.

Food 5/5 - we ordered freshly squeezed sugar cane juice next to stall 62 which was a cheap and refreshing drink. I hadnâ€™t had this in decades. It was delish. We had BBQ chicken wings at stall 62 which was tasty and grilled to perfection. I donâ€™t recall where we ordered the beef chow fun noodles which were average. We had this interesting stir fry dish of deep fried bread and assorted fruit. Not that tasty or appealing. Endless choices of eating places. If youâ€™re ever undecided, look for the long lineups!
Service: 4/5 - youâ€™re given a red buzzer which notifies you what stall to pickup from. A great idea.

Newton Food Centre,3,Alan Phua,"Borderline a touristy place but major changes have been happening.

This place is a mainstay for dinner and supper for many first time tourists to Singapore. There used to be many big tour buses that stop here but it seems to have dwindled down.

Nonetheless food options here are diverse but often too many shops selling the same items - BBQ seafood, Satay, Grilled Chicken Wings - that it becomes impossible to tell the good from the bad.

Prices are generally acceptable but can be on the high side especially for the mainstay Seafood BBQs.

Some menus don't have prices on it so be sure to ask clearly.

Open environment with ample seating hut can get really crowded in the evenings",feedback
Newton Food Centre,5,jazmine miralles,"After a super long day, we came here to eat and relax. Itâ€™s a really cute place! Super clean. Itâ€™s almost like a restaurant with a lot of stores. You order your food and theyâ€™ll bring it to your table or you can pick it up. We had a ton of food however my relative whoâ€™s a local ordered everything so Iâ€™m not sure where they got it and what it is but everything was delicious! Such a nice place to have a food trip. Great portions, tasty food and affordable. LOVED the satay chicken with the peanut dip. Absolutely delicious. And I also tried sugar cane drink for the first time with lime/lemon. I recommend getting it!

However, not sure if itâ€™s 24/7. Maybe some vendors are open 24/7 but not every. We left at around 12 and only a few stalls were open.",feedback
Newton Food Centre,4,sabbynick2003,"Great food at a good price the only issue was it was mostly cash only and the atm there charged $5-$8 to take cash out so definitely bring cash before you go!
The place I ordered at did get my order wrong was meant to get pork and chicken satay but only gave chicken was still delicious.",feedback

Newton Food Centre,4,Nico Samneil Salado,"Different choices of food but mostly seafood, satay and chicken. Vendors are hustlers to entice you to buy. Tables would get full if you go during hours of common dining. CLAYGO but there are some servers who cleans but could not catch up with the volume of people dining. Some vendors accepts creditcards mostly cash. No high chairs.",feedback
Newton Food Centre,5,Emilia Panesar,"On our first day in Singapore, we headed straight to Newton Food Centre to live out my â€œCrazy Rich Asiansâ€ dreamâ€”and it delivered beyond expectations! The vibrant energy and endless options were incredible. We wandered from stall to stall, collecting satays, laksa bowls, and a variety of hawker specialties, all at affordable prices. The seafood was fresh and packed with flavor, and the crispy, perfectly seasoned chicken skewers were a highlight. With its unique circular layout, youâ€™re surrounded by vendors and people from all walks of life, all sharing in this cultural experience. It felt magical and was truly the perfect introduction to Singapore. We loved the vibe so much that we kept coming back throughout our trip. If youâ€™re ever in Singapore, Newton Food Centre is a must-visitâ€”not just because Nick Young says so!",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,4,Christophe Encarnacao,The park is very well maintained with some great attractions but more suitable for people over 7 years old as there are only few ones for the younger ones. We bought the express plus pass and there were too many people and one day was enough as the park is small (this explains only 4 stars),feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,4,Ahmad Fadzel,"Worth it. Be advise, it is crowded and hot weather can ruin your mood haha. Come on weekdays ,less people than weekend. I can't imagine what weekend is like there. Bring your own water bottle because you can fill your bottle for free at water station. Plan your journey such as which ride to go first as the queues are really long as early as 11 am. I suggest go to ancient mummies and light, action, camera studios first. Lastly, enjoy and have a wonderful experience!",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,5,Agatha Gunawan,"Universal Studios Singapore is one of the best theme parks I have visited. Located on Sentosa Island, it offers a fun mix of rides and shows based on popular movies and TV shows. What I really liked about this place was how each area had its own unique theme, like Hollywood or Ancient Egypt, making the whole experience feel magical and different everywhere you went. Overall, I think this park is perfect for families, movie fans, and tourists who want a fun and exciting day out. I would definitely recommend it because it combines entertainment, good service, and tasty food all in one place.",feedback

Universal Studios Singapore,5,Sparsh Gupta,"I had a great time at Universal Studios Singapore!

Universal Studios Singapore,5,Nitin Sahu,"Wow!!! Incredible, huge and fun, for kids and adults alike. Our favourite was the transformer ride and our kid loved Minion land, but truth be told, everything was amazing. And not the just the shows and rides, the staff, the clean washrooms, drinking water taps everywhere. Only downside is waiting period, which is ofcourse expected too, so my recommendation would be to go on a weekday which is not a local holiday. Rest assured, every ride is worth the wait. Enjoy!!",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,4,Pranavi Vikhrankar,We visited universal studios for the first time and it was a memorable day. Just try to go on weekdays to avoid more rush and reach universal studios by 9-9.30 to beat the queue. In the morning there is less rush to the rides. We completed 5 rides till 12 pm and afterwards we were just able to make 3 rides in the remaining day.,feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,5,navid ghannad,"We visited Universal Studios Singapore on a Wednesday, hoping for a more relaxed experience, but the park turned out to be quite busy throughout the day. Wait times for popular rides like Transformers, Battlestar Galactica, and Revenge of the Mummy ranged from 60 to 95 minutes, even in the early afternoon. The crowd levels were unexpectedly high for midweek, which seems to align with what others have reported about the parkâ€™s compact layout and consistently high demand.

One factor that made our visit far smoother was receiving a Guest Assistance Pass (GAP). After presenting a dated doctorâ€™s note and brief explanation at Guest Services near the entrance, we were issued a physical pass that allowed us to access the express lanes via timed return entries. While it might initially feel awkward to disclose medical information, I fully understand the need for documentation to ensure the system is used fairly. The staff handling this process were exceptionally friendly, patient, and respectful, which made the whole procedure feel both professional and supportive.

The GAP system itself was easy to use. At each attraction, we showed the pass, were given a return time (typically a bit shorter than the posted wait), and returned through the express entrance. The setup isnâ€™t digital, unlike systems at some other parks, but it worked reliably and removed much of the exhaustion that extended queueing might otherwise have caused.

The attractions lived up to expectations. Transformers delivered an intense and immersive 3D experience. Battlestar Galacticaâ€™s twin coasters were thrilling, with the Human track offering a smoother, more comfortable ride. Revenge of the Mummy combined dark ride elements with sudden drops and sharp turns, remaining one of the parkâ€™s highlights. We also appreciated Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure, a water ride that was both fun and surprisingly long, and Shrek 4D, which offered a lighthearted pause from the more intense experiences.

We had lunch at one of the food outlets inside the park and chose the Family Feast set. For SGD 88, it included two large soups, one large pizza, four desserts, and four soft drinks. It wasnâ€™t gourmet, but the portions were generous, the food was decent, and the pricing was fair by theme park standards. It made for an easy and efficient shared lunch.

What stood out beyond the attractions themselves was the attitude of the staff. Every person we encounteredâ€”from the ride attendants to the Guest Services teamâ€”was polite, accommodating, and genuinely understanding. They took their time to explain the procedures, never made us feel rushed or scrutinized, and showed a level of professionalism that added a human warmth to the day.

Even with the long lines and high visitor numbers, we came away feeling that the park experience had been well thought out, especially for guests with specific needs. The GAP made a significant difference, and while the requirement to show medical documentation is understandable, the process was handled with empathy and discretion. All in all, it was a memorable visit, made smoother by thoughtful accommodations and excellent staff interactions.",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,3,Marlene Barnes,"Visited Universal Studios Singapore on a Sunday. The park was overly crowded and the wait time for most attractions was 30â€“60 mins or more, which made the experience tiring. While the rides and attractions were good, the priority tickets were way too overpriced. Food inside the park is also quite expensive. For the price we paid, we expected better crowd management and overall experience.",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,5,Abiyyu Raihan Putra Wikanto,"One of the most-visited destination in Singapore! Most groups probably have this place in their itinerary if they're going to Singapore...

Basically it'a theme park located in an island south of Singapore. Connected by a monorail to VivoCity Mall which is interestingly only charged if you're going Sentosa Island.

The theme park is very big. There is :
â€¢ Egypt section with an amazing cafetaria,
â€¢ A 1920's USA style town,
â€¢ Lots of rail that includes amusement rides and roller coaster,
â€¢ A big lake in the middle,
â€¢ Castle with dreamworks character (puss in boots and others),
â€¢ Waterworld show,
â€¢ Battlestar Galactica section with a thrilling rollercoaster (there is locker to store items to here),
â€¢ Transformer amusement ride that feels 3D,
â€¢ Sesame street small amusement ride.

You could probably spend half a days here. Brings your friend and family. Do note that while some places here offer halal food, it is quite costly. Prices can be up to 14$ for butter chicken rice (tasty tho). There is an option to just eat at a cafetaria outside which is cheaper and do have halal food.

If you're looking for a prayer room there is one near Battlestar Galactica section, however it's a bit cramped. If you're a muslim and want an alternatives, there is a masjid near VivoCity.",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,3,Harshit Gupta,"Universal Studios Singapore was a childhood dream, but the reality didnâ€™t match up. Long 2-hour waits for rides that last just 5 minutes made the experience frustrating. The park felt average, with nothing truly exciting.

If you still want to visit, make sure to buy Express Tickets, or youâ€™ll spend most of your time just standing in lines. Honestly, Imagica in Maharashtra offers a better and smoother experience. Not worth coming to Singapore just for this.",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,5,Bharat ARV,"Very nice enjoying place.

Universal Studios Singapore,4,NIVESH MANECKCHUND,"Universal Studios instantly transported me back to childhood with its nostalgic charm, stunning architecture, and immersive atmosphere. Every corner of the park felt like stepping into a storybook, and the rides? Absolutely out of this world â€” thrilling, imaginative, and worth the hype.

That said, be prepared for long wait times. We booked for a weekday, expecting lighter crowds, but it was still bustling! If youâ€™re not a fan of lines, the Express Pass might help, but keep in mindâ€”itâ€™s priced more for die-hard fans than casual visitors.

A small letdown was not being allowed to take videos or photos during the rides. And yes, food and drinks inside the park lean toward the pricier side, so plan accordingly.",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,5,anita n,"This is a must place not on once in life time but multiple times for sure.

The chicken was dry, the rice was just okay, and the whole thing felt pretty basic. Plus, there was barely any veg, so it didnâ€™t feel like the healthiest option.

The food court itself has a cool rounded design, but it gets super hot around lunchtime, which just adds to the discomfort. Not the best start to my food journey here!",feedback
Newton Food Centre,4,Arjun Butani,"I last came to the Newton food center pre-pandemic and then not again. I was afraid it had lost it's buzz and it's best food stalls. Tonight I returned and what a meal it was.
Singapore is one place where I feel safe eating streetfood.

This is everything I ate. The singapore special, chilli mud crab. Thank god I wore a black t-shirt because it was truly a hot mess. I had this with a side of egg fried rice. The next two are king prawns, in their shells, baked in butter and topped with a copious amounts of garlic. What was interesting about it was that instead of a lime/lemon wedge, it had a mandarin orange wedge. So I squeezed in the orange juice, and it completed the dish.

Then two exotic meats, first the stingray fin, grilled and then topped with a spicy bean sauce. The meat of stingray is flaky, like cod but chewy like shrimp- so the taste of it is somewhere between a fish and shellfish- and slightly sweet too. The gonggong or sea snails or conch, were melting in my mouth. They were slowly steamed with butter and then served with a very hot sauce. Messy and tedious to pull out and eat but so worth it- nowhere else would I eat the conch snails. The dish after that is a crispy small squid, chopped and fried and then tossed with chilli sauce.
Then the dessert because those who know me, know that I take dessert seriously and for me it's my favourite part of the dish. It's an ice kachang- shaved ice, topped with syrups such as rose. Additions to it include grass jelly, red beans, longan fruit, coconut jelly and corn. It's an iconic Asian dessert, popular across Malaysia too. The other dessert is a simple mangos with longan fruit. The other two dishes are, one an omelette and a cheese roti paratta, a malayu-indian rendition to the simple parantha - which was served with a chicken curry.

What fun being back here and what fun eating streetfood guilt free. The market is back to normal, buzzing with tables full of friends, families and lovers. It was a cool evening, so perfect and lovely to sit out and have this meal over pints of beers and lots of catching up.",feedback

A bit sad that WaterWorld was under renovation, itâ€™s my all-time favorite show.

Food is pricey and taste is regular, but the adorable presentation made it impossible to resist.

Canâ€™t wait to return!",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,5,Abhishek Pratap Singh,"Amazing and a must to visit place . Here are lots of things you can do with your friends and family.
My suggestion for the tourist to avoid the rides where the rush is high. First do the rides or attend the shows where waiting time is very less and by doing this you can take the maximum rides and attend almost every show.
Second option you buy the early access pass but for me it was expensive still if it allows your pocket I suggest those take the pass once you entered in the universal studio. early access passes are available inside. Do not try to do first ride without pass because your ride make take longer waiting time and after do one or two rides there is wastage of money if you buy early pass after that.

3 4 rides are must to do like transformers,  the mummy , roller-coaster rides , jurassic park.
Shows are dependent on your choices it may very if your with kids or friends . You can choose shows accordingly if you are running short of time.",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,5,Sami,"Universal Studios Singapore is not very large, which actually makes it easy and enjoyable to explore in one day without feeling rushed. The layout is convenient, and walking between zones is quick and straightforward.

The shops are pleasant and well-themed, offering a nice break between rides. During our visit, the wait times for the most popular attractions didnâ€™t exceed 30 minutes â€” a great surprise!

The park is also very clean, and we appreciated the water dispensers placed throughout, including inside some of the queue areas. This small detail really made a difference on a hot day.

Overall, itâ€™s a fun, well-managed park â€” perfect for families or anyone looking for a relaxed theme park experience",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,5,Edward Pena,Had a great experience. For convenience buy tickets in advance and of you love riding rides and rollercoasters I highly recommend buying an express ticket to skip the queues. U can ride multiple rides multiple times and end up in the first row.,feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,5,Thang Nguyen,"A fantastic day of fun and adventure!

Universal Studios Singapore might be smaller than other Universal parks, but itâ€™s incredibly well done and full of excitement. The rides are top-notch â€” Transformers, Jurassic Park and Revenge of the Mummy were my favorites, and Battlestar Galactica is a must if you love rollercoasters. And also make sure to keep track of the water show schedule as well, also very recommend to watch.

The park is clean, well-organized, and easy to get around. Great mix of attractions for all ages, from high-adrenaline rides to fun shows and kid-friendly zones. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the atmosphere throughout the park was lively and enjoyable.

Definitely worth getting the Express Pass if youâ€™re visiting on a busy day â€” it saves a lot of waiting time.

Overall, an awesome experience for families, couples, or groups of friends. Canâ€™t wait to come back!",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,5,Han Zaw Oo,"It has so many fun ride inside for kids friendly and adult. Height limitations are applied for certain rides. When we arrived 9:45 (15 min before open), it had a long queue. Express ticket is available at the ticket counter but better check the volume of ppl inside prior buying. Express ticket could buy inside as well. If you come since opening and not much interested in some rides, better not buy - not worth to pay. After lunch time, some rides are no more queue.

We enjoyed for 4D rides in Far Far Way, Minions and Jurassic rides. Target to finish all rides by lunch time then you could repeat which rides you like. Some rides need to keep your belongings but pay-locker are available. If you rent pay-locker, pls keep till you finish other rides as it ll make you repetitive renting and cost you a lot.

Lunch inside is too expensive compared to portion. Drinking Water could get at each station. Better bring rain coat or umbrella cos rain is unpredictable. If not rain, it ll be too hot, so better bring umbrella.

Car park is max SGD 16-17 per day and easy to access.

Overall worth to visit.",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,5,Sabilla,"If you like adrenaline, this is not the place.the rides was fun but not that scary. Food was average.

Universal Studios Singapore,4,Ra Jiv,"Universal Studios was absolutely amazing! I managed to hit all the main rides except for Galactica and the water ride â€” but no regrets, because everything else was pure FUN!

Shrek 4D was a hilarious, feel-good experience, and if youâ€™re a Minion fan, the Minion zone is a must-see (cutest chaos ever!).

It's useful downloading the app as it gives you show times as well as meet and greet opportunities which was our highlight as we don't do rides in general. Only did one

Universal Studios Singapore,1,Peer,"Unbelievable how this park has been declining in the past few years.
The problem is simple: they sell too many tickets, and offer way too little rides and shows in return. Visiting on a Monday with very bad weather, (rainfall all day) the queues for all the main rides were 2/3 or more hours with no exceptions all day long. During my visit I managed to ride 2 attractions whilst being in the park for 7 hours.

They have a terrible Regular & Express pass division which is purely meant to milk more money out of people. With a regular entry, expect to be queuing for 3 hours for the main ride (Human/Cylon) and 1-2 hours for all the other rides, even the carousel was an hour wait. It gets so bad that they end up temporarily closing big rides to prevent queue overflowing. The irony is that the rides arenâ€™t exactly in great condition, lots of them with broken animatronics & effects.

You end up being pretty much forced to purchase overpriced express lane tickets just to be able to ride more than a handful of rides.

Despite all of this, the staff was still kind and tried their best to assist the hoards of visibly frustrated visitors. The park simply need to put a cap on the amount of visitors allowed into the rather small park, donâ€™t waste your money on this place until they clean up their mess. Worst Universal park in the world.",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,3,Cry_ stal,"Universal studios Singapore, you get more heat from the sun than heat from action.
Getting to sentosa Island is straightforward and can easily be done with public transport.

The set decorations and characters here are plentiful and beautifully crafted. There are plenty of photo opportunities to take with them.

There is however a lack of ventilation and fans here. When waiting for the rides or attractions there was a lack of fans. Everybody around me was complaining with many children crying and people tired before the attraction even started. So many times I thought I would pass out from the heat.

The only place with proper ventilation and air conditioning was inside the gift shops. A lot of people were standing and sitting inside there because it was so hot outside.
I would recommend for more indoor seating or seating with shade that is accessible for visitors.

The shrek 4d show was good and worth waiting for. The waiting room there at least had an air conditioner.

The lights, camera actions attraction was good but would have been better if there was more to see. The wait times was listed 15 minutes but was definitely more than that.

The food was of course overpriced, which is to be expected. We had the burgers from the diner and they tasted okay and were served with fries.

The crowd control was good for the most part.

I would recommend going here if you have kids or a group of friends. Otherwise I would recommend going to universal studios Japan, especially during the cooler season.",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,5,Ganesh Paudyal,"Great Place to visit. One of the favourite place in singapore. Children will enjoy a lot. Not only children, adult and everyone will enjoy here. One must visit this place. Amazing shows, drama, 3D, 4D experience and lots of games. One should go for this amazing experience.",feedback
Universal Studios Singapore,4,Abhigyan Kumar,"Good: the transformer ride, rollercoaster, mummy ride are absolutely the best!

Improvement:
Could use with a bit more no of rides (to be fair when we went one section of the park was closed)",feedback
Newton Food Centre,5,just Wai,"Not much of service this place is an hawker centre.
When you search for newton food, most of the result will lead you to this hawker. This hawker is 600m away from Newton Mrt?
Let get straight to the food.
I visited 4 stores via google search for their popular food.

1-52 Tiong Bahru Durian 10/10
If you like durian, you definitely should try this dessert here. $10 for double scoup of MaoShanWang Durian with the durian mousse. Is very worthy.

1-33 TKR @ Newton Chicken Wing 8.7/10
Non-halal, I ordered their pork and satay. Meat is pretty good, not the best but great standard. I LOVE THEIR SATAY SAUCE ALOT, just nice sweet and smooth. Chicken Wing is decent too. If I came back this hawker, i will order it again.

1-28 Heng Fried Oyster Omelette 11points/10
This is by the best fried oyster omelete i have eaten this year. This year i have eat probably more then 20times of oyster omelette. This one really did it well, crispy and strong taste. Love it. Will be back for this again.

1-25 Newton Old Signboard Hokkien Mee 7.8/10
Pretty good for Hokkien mee, their sotong and prawn is also gives decent amount but bigger. Taste are good and gravy is great.

I will be back for their oyster and durian for sure.",feedback
Newton Food Centre,5,KC Heng,"Located near Newton MRT. Lively at night, some areas are sheltered while some areas are not. Can be a bit pricey due to being a popular tourist spot. Good to try a variety of food without spending too much",feedback
Newton Food Centre,3,Kaiâ€™ula,Very crowded hardly any open tables. Found one for four after about half an hourâ€¦granted it was a Friday night around 7pm. Have to be in the right place at the right time. Itâ€™s better after 9pm. Got carrot cake with prawns and oyster omelette from stall 27. Was told itâ€™ll take about an hour. No problem since we ordered noodles along with chicken and rice from another stall.,feedback
Newton Food Centre,5,Rene ThÃ¶ne,"Real good and affordable food.
The most huts are the same and replaceable (Chicken WIngs & Squid). I checked the pictures here in Google maps: A lot of this huts are not existing anymore, and replaced by standard food- and Drink Booth. But there are some absolute different huts, you can easy found just by walking around. We had a fish (don't know which one), very tasty, served in a absolute tasty soup. Thumbs up! And fresh sugar cane juice with lemon... delicious! and a tomato soup with chicken, and something more... everything of this was so fingerlicking good! And the serving was good for 4, maybe 5 Guests, for 50 S$! If you have guests from abroad: Bring them here to have a very very good street food evening, also the beer is affordable (e.g. 2 Chinese Beer Ã¡ 0.5 Ltr together for 11 S$).",feedback
Newton Food Centre,4,Crumpled Nomad,"A good place to go for local fare. Some of the items that we ordered was really good, better than a lot of other hawker centres here in Singapore. The car park was full when we visited on a Saturday night. Could see that the place was swamped with tourists and locals alike. Some notable stalls are the bah chor mee stall facing the carpark, the bib gourmand fried carrot cakes and fried oysters and not forgetting the chicken wings and satay. Getting seats was not difficult though even though the place was crowded.",feedback
Newton Food Centre,4,M-C. Camille,"Second time here. We tried one the Michelin stall famous for their duck and liked it. I wanted to try their crispy pork but it was sold out, next time maybe.
The whole food center was packed.",feedback
Newton Food Centre,4,Taylor Deni,"I went for lunch on a Friday.  Not too busy at all.  Maybe it is busier in the evening.  There are a lot of stalls.  However, a quarter of them were closed.  A majority were open.  Most of the seating is outdoor.  There is some sheltered seating.  Best to avoid going on a rainy day.  Reasonably clean.  Literally a 4-minute walk from Newton MRT and clearly signposted.  A few of the stalls are recommended by the MICHELIN Guide.  I went to Alliance Seafood which is.  Worth going there if you like seafood.  It is pricey however.",feedback
Newton Food Centre,5,Nur Hidayah,"This place is famous because of Crazy Rich Asian movie. This place got many stalls selling foods, but if you are looking for Halal one, make sure it got Halal label. I would recommend you to try their oyster omelette",feedback
Newton Food Centre,3,Michael W.,"We come here mainly for the movie - Crazy Rich Asians. We know it has fewer food choices than other famous food centers.

We ordered only a few drinks and giant prawns for a snack. The drinks are okay, but the prawns are not very fresh! The Newton Food Centre also has a lot of parking available.",feedback
Newton Food Centre,3,Cindy Nee,Only few stalls open during lunch hour on a Sunday. Can see that this is a tourist spot as most of the people dining here are foreigners. Food is ok just to fill up our stomach.,feedback
Newton Food Centre,5,Lin shai,"Always be the place to go when we craving for satay Chicken, and shrimp .  And the Egg Friend Rice. Power sia!!!",feedback
Newton Food Centre,5,Jeremy Lim,"Not as overhyped as people may claim. You can find decent food here (carrot cake, sambal stingray, popiah, oyster omelette) albeit pricier than other Hawkers. Atmosphere is really nice in night/evenings.",feedback
Newton Food Centre,5,Nick Hogg,"Amazing food with plenty of choices, well worth the visit.  If the locals flock to this place as much as the tourists, it should be a good sign and it was.",feedback
Newton Food Centre,5,Tito Mark,"This was the closest hawker centre from where I was staying and visited a few times. Enjoyed the food, even the atmosphere. There is agood amount of selection - for chicken and seafood! Some advice, I wouldn't get lost in the Michelin star hawker joints as I feel once you had one BBQ chicken, you had em all. Since I visited this place a few times, I tried a joint that made a great curry chicken and another that had great noodle in soup.
Singapore is hot and humid, Newton is outdoor and I went once middle of the day and I felt like I was melting!! Best is to visit at night with a group of friends, order different plates even from different stalls, grab a brew. Drink, eat, laugh and enjoy!",feedback
Newton Food Centre,5,Rye Rei,Hawker food market busy place lots of food choices good prices we had the stingray and cereal prawn stall 53 so good had to have a second helping of the prawn. Good price Tiger Beer as well easy to get via MRT.,feedback
Newton Food Centre,5,mathu salah,"Newton Food Centre is the best places in Singaporean . It offers a wide variety of delicious food and drinks â€” from sizzling satay and fresh seafood to local favourites like BBQ stingray, oyster omelette, and laksa. The atmosphere is lively, with an open-air dining area that's perfect for a casual night out. Prices are reasonable, and the food is freshly prepared.",feedback
Newton Food Centre,3,Sarah Aziz,"One of the most pricy food street in Singapore. I have tried many stalls to taste the flavours of Singapore and I enjoyed it.
We tried chilli crabs,  oyster omelete, rice cake satay, fish porridge, stingray, fried rice and chilli beef, sugar cane juice and couple of other plates.Also itâ€™s closed on Monday.",feedback
Newton Food Centre,4,Sheue Lin Ng,"The food here is nice. The question is which stall. There are many repeated stalls selling the same thing. Even for us locals, sometimes we forgot which stall is nice.
So just go with your gut feeling.  We ended up ordering fried oysters with eggs, rojak with dried squid and fried carrot cake.
The fried oysters were amazing because the eggs we fried till crispy. The fried carrot cake was delicious too. The rojak cost 10. It came with a generous amount of dried BBQ squid. Very flavorful dish.",feedback
Newton Food Centre,3,Matthew Lee,"A very touristy place. Haven been here for ages and was around the area so decided to pop by for dinner. It was drizzling so I was thinking might not be crowded but I was so wrong!
Because the outdoor seats were wet and empty the indoor area was so packed. You even see tourists coming here with luggage and blocking pathways.
This place is not really very appealing to me cause the stalls are just selling repetitive food. Chicken wings, oyster omelette, seafood, BBQ prawns and stingrays and satay.
I just happened to visit some of the more popular stalls, and I usually go to the fish soup, fishball noodles and the oyster omelette. It's definitely a trap to be eating seafood especially crabs here the prices are rather ridiculous.
My recommendations will be those stalls that I have posted the photos. The rest are just stalls which I have never tried or tried but not memorable.",feedback
Newton Food Centre,5,Luis Villegas,"Stall #36, get cereal prawn, fried rice, baby squid and make your sg trip memorable. Youâ€™re welcome Ã¼",feedback
