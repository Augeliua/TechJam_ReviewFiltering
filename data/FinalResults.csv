When I went up to ask if I could borrow or rent one, the lady at the concierge didn't even look at me until i paused to wait for her to look up and assumed she was busy even though she already said ""hi"" while looking down. She then told me I had to pay a $50 deposit to borrow the portable charger, which I am completely fine with and understand the need for. She appeared shocked when I said I was fine with the $50 deposit so I just said it again that I was completely fine with it. She continued staring at me and just said ""$50 deposit"" which honestly confused me because she didn't ask me how I wanted to pay and didn't tell me only cash was accepted and repeated it until I asked her if only cash payment was available. I then told her that i didn't have cash and asked if card payment was available to which she replied ""there's an ATM""... I don't carry cash around and that's not her fault but I really think that for a mall like  paragon that the staff, especially at the concierge to have some sort of customer service training.

The hotel's location is quite convenient, being just 300m from Bugis MRT and with a bus station right in front of the building, making it easy to get around Singapore.  One of the highlights is that the hotel is surrounded by plenty of restaurants, though if you're looking for halal food, youâ€™ll need to walk around 600m. Itâ€™s still manageable, but something to keep in mind.  As for the room, we stayed in a quad room,which was decent in size and comfortable for our stay.

*Taking into account value for money

I was here a few weeks ago (and drank teh tarik siu dai), didn't know this is a Srisun Express outlet 

Now I'm back to eat Indian rojak for breakfast....

Had wanted to try the ""famous"" prata at this HDB block (681) but decided to pass as #MHTamChiak isn't too keen on crispy (but super oily) kosong (no matter how good the curry is) 

They have prata here as well, but no hurry to try as I've eaten at Srisun (Sgoon Gdns) before -- I expect a similar standard (though I think it had gone down quite a bit over the years ).

I checked if they had to re-fry the rojak pieces, as I'd rather not have them oily. Too bad, they had to as some items are actually not fully cooked!

So there went the cuttlefish, deep fried till it had a ""skin"". Definitely not to my liking as it destroyed the texture 

Otherwise, the rojak pieces are rather fresh, as can be seen with the tau kwa 

Potato, small fish cake and plain dough ball were also very good 

So next time I'll just leave out the cuttlefish lol

The gravy is light and hardly contained peanuts!? It tasted slightly spicy, which really went well with the rojak. Usually I will have to ask for another serving... and so I did! 

Strangely, they weren't generous with cut cucumber -- a staple that's great to dunk into the gravy -- and green chilli.

Overall, this was a satisfying and full breakfast. Complete with the requisite teh tarik, of course 

But at $9.90 for this meal -- tea alone is 2.40! -- I'm not keen to return as there are other wallet friendly places to enjoy good rojak!",feedback,visit date: 11 mar 2025 actual rating: 3.5 taking account value money week ago drank teh tarik siu dai know srisun express outlet back eat indian rojak breakfast.... wanted try famous prata hdb block 681 decided pas mhtamchiak keen crispy super oily kosong no matter good curry prata well no hurry try eaten srisun sgoon gdns -- expect similar standard though think gone quite bit year . checked re-fry rojak piece rather not oily. bad item actually not fully cooked went cuttlefish deep fried till skin . definitely not liking destroyed texture otherwise rojak piece rather fresh seen tau kwa potato small fish cake plain dough ball also good next time leave cuttlefish lol gravy light hardly contained peanut tasted slightly spicy really went well rojak. usually ask another serving... strangely generous cut cucumber -- staple great dunk gravy -- green chilli. overall satisfying full breakfast. complete requisite teh tarik course 9.90 meal -- tea alone 2.40 -- not keen return wallet friendly place enjoy good rojak,feedback,1.0,feedback,0,1,0,0
Srisun Express - Hougang Ave 8,3.0,Gavin Koh,"Priced a little too expensive food for a heartland store. My order was $9.40 for 2 egg pratas and 2 teh tariks whereas I could have paid only $6.40 elsewhere.

The scan-the-QR-code-and-order menu wasn't working that well; it was very laggy or seemed to have hung. Even the waitress came to confirm whether I had ordered correctly (after I managed to get it to work on my phone... by patiently waiting). The waitress probably anticipated problems with ordering.

At least the food was hot and arrived quite fast, but the prata looked rather small, as if less dough was used; curry was just enough and quite tasty and slightly crispy. The teh tarik was OK, nothing spectacular.

Srisun Express - Hougang Ave 8,4.0,Josh Kuek (#jkgourmets),"Newest Indian Mamak stall in Hougang. Located in the corner beside cross junction traffic. Very spacious and well decorated, quite comfortable and cossy seating near the roadside.

They serve full Indian menu from Prata, Dosai to Rojak, Briyani to all stir fried comfort foods and of course all traditional drinks.

First, we try their Indian Rojak, very crispy and quite fresh fried stuffed. Dipping potato chilli gravy was not bad too.
We also tried their Dosai, just the plain one, taste was good unfortunately not so crispy and dipping sauces was slightly not to plain, lack of flavours.

In the other day, we take away 2 pieces of grilled Naan bread, wow, it was very fluffy, fragrance, and delicious. Slight sweet and savory taste. Veylry well balanced flavors. Unfortunately, 2 pieces cost $5.50 was too expensive, it was only a plain bread without filling.

On my third visit, trying new dishes, instead of plain thosai, this time I try masala thosai, which is potatoes fillings, very delicious, worth my first try. Yummy.

Another new dish was a fried Bee Hoon with tandoori chicken set, price at $13 each. You have option of the carb, either Fried Rice, Mee, Bee Hoon, Kway-Tiao or Maggi Mee. It was delicious, especially my fried Bee-Hoon, is moist and not oily, and full of wok-hey. Tandoori chicken is yummy but slightly dry inside, can be better.

Overall, I do recommend this Indian stall to all, due to it tidy, clean, comfort and cossy atmosphere. Foods was not bad, table and chairs and environment was clean too, unfortunately, price was slightly high for me. Nevertheless, try it especially if you never visit.

Srisun Express - Hougang Ave 8,5.0,Avriel Peter,"Canâ€™t believe what I just ate! Such fantastic indian cuisine. Ive been travelling around trying different indian food, and even had 3 friends from india teaching me how to eat poori, naan and all sorts of interesting food yesterday. Decided to try Sri Sun today since it is close to my home.

The cost is really good. Higher than other places, but the value was so much more! Eg the poori came with a wholesome amount of potato filling. My nasi briyani was placed beautifully with tender succulent chicken. The curry is thick, savoury, and very flavourful.

Environment is ok. We had 7 pax, which they could handle, but 8 would not cut it unless you want a separate table.

Nitha helped us most of the time, and could explain even more on each dish (yes, we were adventurous and wanted to add some food we have not yet tasted).

Every dish that I often travel around trying, was cooked to perfection (I dare say better). Generosity from drinks to food and sauces made the meal joyful and fulfilling.

I am coming back for sure!

Couple of things for improvement:
1. Papadom was soft and hence hard to eat.
2. Needs cooling. An internal aircon or something that can cool down the place.
3. More sitting areas for 8-10pax.

Ill be sure to make a special request on #1 to be done right the next time I visit.

We placed our order at 9 am, but unfortunately, they missed out on our plain prata, which left us waiting until around 9:55 am to receive it. This delay was quite frustrating.

Moreover, the honey lemon drink we ordered didn't meet our expectations.

As for the food, the nasi goreng kampong was noticeably salty, which made it less enjoyable.

The Mee Goreng, a quintessential Malaysian dish, was flawlessly executed at Srisun Express. The noodles were stir-fried to perfection, carrying a deep smoky flavor with a hint of spiciness. What made this particular version unique and noteworthy was the inclusion of tender Chicken Tikka pieces that added an extra dimension of taste to the dish. The flavors were well balanced, and the chicken tikka enhanced the overall savory experience. Unlike other Tikka, this is fresh from lived grill and not in microwave oven.

Accompanying the Mee Goreng was a side of Prata, which turned out to be a heavenly addition to the meal. The prata, with its crispy yet soft texture, was served piping hot and paired perfectly with the savory flavors of the Mee Goreng. It was truly a match made in culinary heaven.

The portion size was generous, ensuring that I left the restaurant feeling completely satisfied. The prices at Srisun Express are also quite reasonable for the quality and quantity of food served, making it a great value for money dining option.

What made it worse was the receptionist was unapologetic about it and was even rude to us. She was trying to imply that she was doing us a favor of rushing the housekeepers. Besides us, there were also other guests who had been waiting for 3 hours for their rooms and were given inconclusive responses. In addition to the rude attitude of the staff, the room was not cleaned properly. The room smelled and the linens were itchy.",feedback,beware false review site. reason multiple positive review site due ongoing promotion guest receive cash back leave positive comments. stayed 3 day may 30 june 1. arrived 3 pm check receptionist told u room not yet ready since two housekeepers. made worse receptionist unapologetic even rude us. trying imply u favor rushing housekeepers. besides u also guest waiting 3 hour room given inconclusive responses. addition rude attitude staff room not cleaned properly. room smelled linen itchy.,feedback,0.9,feedback,0,1,0,0

Hotel Calmo Bugis,1.0,Jobelle Ann Ramos,"Take a look at the photos of the rooms, and reduce your expectations by 20x. In person, these rooms look unfinished, cluttered and can barely be called neat.

Looking at the triple room? Decrease your expectations by a further 10x. If they give you the corner rooms, 601 and 605, you'll get a little more real estate than the middle rooms. The double bed is okay, serves it's purpose and can definitely fit 2 comfortably even with a baby in between. The extra bed though, is just a single couch with an ottoman added to the end held together by a fitted sheet. And no it's not one of those plush couches, it's as cheap as couches get.

The bathroom is certainly decent. Sizeable enough with a hot and cold shower. If you're on the plus size of things, the toilet is a bit of a squeeze.

Now for the horror story. Of the 3 days we spent in this hotel, we were only able to use the elevators, twice. Twice! And we were on the 6th floor, a group that had senior citizens and a toddler. so to cap off every day of adventure, we had to go walk up the stairs to the 6th floor. We didn't even complain about it anymore, not allowing it ruin our vacation.

The day before were to depart, we gave them a heads up to let them know that we had 13 pcs of luggage between all of us and that at no point were we bringing these down the stairs ourselves. We gave them advanced notice so that they could make arrangements for this. The receptionist even tried to say they would ""help"" us carry the bags down, but we were clear to her that we would not carry 1 bag down. We were clear that they needed to carry all 13 down.

We were travelling with a toddler, and family who were in their late 40s and 50s and who all had their own share of aches and pains. We did not want to risk anyone getting injured carrying these heavy bags down flights of stairs.

Day of departure came, and they did not arrange anything. The receptionist did nothing at all to prepare, and had to carry some of the bags herself and had to wait for another staff to carry the heavier bags. we checked out at 9 am and this whole ordeal ate into our last day which was supposed to be spent enjoying more of Singapore. We were finally able to leave the hotel at 11 am,

Despite attempts to address the issue with the hotel staff, the problem persisted throughout my stay, negatively impacting the overall ambiance of the room.Another significant drawback of this hotel was its proximity to a noisy bar. The loud music and rowdy patrons late into the night created a constant disturbance, making it challenging to get a good night's sleep. On top of that, the thin walls offered little sound insulation, and I could clearly hear a baby crying from the neighboring room.

If youâ€™re coming from Changi, just take the Green Line to Bugis station.

Check-in was fast and easy. Just remember to get SGD first since thereâ€™s a 100$ deposit. Theyâ€™ll give you a receipt. Keep it so you can get the deposit back.

Evevator was a bit confusing. Just make sure to tap your access card before pressing the floor, and not the other way around.

When we entered the room, it was spacious. Industrial design. Can easily lay 3 open luggages. Theres also a water heater, iron, hairblower, and iron rack, TV, mini fridge, and AC unit.

In the shower, there was hot and cold water for both the shower and sink.

TAKE NOTE, THEREâ€™S A BIDET! â€” not all hotel in SG have a Bidet. Only a handful actually. And Hotel Calmo Bugis is one of them.

The alley adjacent to the hotel are all food stalls so no need to worry about food. Theres also a convenience store at the other end. Bugis junction and Alberts Hawker are just a few minutes away if you want to save on money for food, or buy souvenirs.

Hotel Calmo Bugis,2.0,Royals Capital,"When We stay here on Saturday, it was pleasant.
The room is not that big as like other Singapore budget hotel. Itâ€™s like an apartment studio. Thereâ€™s microwave and pantry on the 2nd floor. The location is quite strategic, lots of resto bars and shopping centre around the area. The hot water, wifi are good. The TV channel isnâ€™t good, only 4 channel works and most channel are blinking. I will give it 4 stars.

Yet, when We come back to the hotel 4 days after that, the reception girl accused Us that we broke the toilet cups and We must pay for $20. Offcourse We donâ€™t want to pay as they have no prove that We broke it 4 days ago. We already put $100 deposit for each room, and when We check out 4 days before the reception said everything is good. This is the first time We had an experience like this.
What happen if We didnâ€™t come back to that Hotel, how are you going to charge us?

The reception said She called her boss, by the way she doesnâ€™t called in front of us. She then come back and said the boss will waive the broken cups and if itâ€™s happen again they will charge Us for $100. When we check out, the reception check our rooms and we offer to check it together, but she doesnâ€™t want as she said it was the procedure.

Hey boss, if you read this you better learn about hotel management and customer satisfactions. If you argue to your customer, even though you win, yet you still lose the customer.

For other customer that want to stay in this hotel, make sure you make a unboxing room video, as they might accuse you broke something and take advantages. Another tips, ask to get new linen and pillow case, as Iâ€™m sure they didnâ€™t change to a new one when the customer before you check out. We stay here 2 times and booked 3 rooms, and all the linen and pillow case stinks. Do you itâ€™s a coincident?

The room was very worn out, small (lied on pictures and booking) and a lot of the furniture and bathroom tools were broken. All the bed and bathroom related things (pillows, linens, covers, sheets, towels) were all soiled and so worn out from previous guests you can see various stains and chipping or breaking. When we asked for room cleaning and replacement of pillow cases and bed linens and towels, we were only given pillow cases and towels as they were having issues with their external laundry service and the housekeepers donâ€™t clean the rooms at all even though theyâ€™re supposed to be cleaning all rooms at 5pm. As the front desk staff also seemed troubled by their housekeepers, we would be the ones going to the front desk everytime we needed new towels, tissue paper and water even though housekeeping should be doing it. Everytime we entered our room again everything was exactly the same, they couldnâ€™t even just sweep the floors as the bare minimum. It also felt really disgusting because you can smell the body odor from the beds and pillows. Their sofa bed is also not a sofa bed at all but just a regular sofa which they cover with a dirty bed sheet thatâ€™s not for the size of the sofa at all.

I'm not sure about the food, because mine never came.
The drink is ok, slightly on the sweeter side.

Arrived and was given the menu quite promptly, but heck, a delusion of ""good service""
It's more like pressing you to order something which, might not come.

Ordered some pratas through a male staff around 11.30 am.

30 mins later, I called him over to checked the status of my order, to which he seemed confused. He repeated my order, and I saw him walking over to another female staff gesturing towards me.

Another 30 mins passed, and my food is still not served, I called the staff over again to check on my order to which he told me ""coming soon"" while going over to inform the kitchen.

Well, another 45 mins went by and my food shows no signs of arriving.

I paid for my drink and left. Never gonna be back again.

Our children especially loved the themed rides and character meet-and-greets â€” seeing their favorite movie characters come to life was a real highlight! The staff were friendly, helpful, and made sure everything ran smoothly.

We also appreciated the shaded areas and rest spots, which made it easy to take breaks throughout the day. There were plenty of food options, and the park was very family-friendly overall.

We visited on a weekday and still wait time for main rides were almost 120mins (2hours), meaning we cannot take more than 3 rides. After spending lot of money and not able to use all the rides is like total waste.

No benefits even on express pass.

Plus some rides come into maintenance, so if someone waited for 1hr but cannot complete the ride. (No ride + time wasted).
