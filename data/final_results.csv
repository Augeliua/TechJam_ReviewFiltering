When I went up to ask if I could borrow or rent one, the lady at the concierge didn't even look at me until i paused to wait for her to look up and assumed she was busy even though she already said ""hi"" while looking down. She then told me I had to pay a $50 deposit to borrow the portable charger, which I am completely fine with and understand the need for. She appeared shocked when I said I was fine with the $50 deposit so I just said it again that I was completely fine with it. She continued staring at me and just said ""$50 deposit"" which honestly confused me because she didn't ask me how I wanted to pay and didn't tell me only cash was accepted and repeated it until I asked her if only cash payment was available. I then told her that i didn't have cash and asked if card payment was available to which she replied ""there's an ATM""... I don't carry cash around and that's not her fault but I really think that for a mall like  paragon that the staff, especially at the concierge to have some sort of customer service training.

Yes I acknowledge that it was my fault as I booked for July24 instead of June24 but its really clear that it was made by mistake since I was in the actual hotel when I made the booking. I told the receptionist that I just cancel the July24 and book a different one (June24). The receptionist also cant do anything on their end.This was supposed to be just an extension of our stay as we dont want to be staying at the airport anymore (as originally planned).

Itâ€™s still manageable, but something to keep in mind.  As for the room, we stayed in a quad room,which was decent in size and comfortable for our stay.

They donâ€™t have any hanger rack on the bathroom so your new clothes or bath towel no place inside of the bathroom. You have to go outside with your roommate nude to get your new clothes and bath towel. Sink are lightly clogged too.

*Taking into account value for money

I was here a few weeks ago (and drank teh tarik siu dai), didn't know this is a Srisun Express outlet 

Now I'm back to eat Indian rojak for breakfast....

Had wanted to try the ""famous"" prata at this HDB block (681) but decided to pass as #MHTamChiak isn't too keen on crispy (but super oily) kosong (no matter how good the curry is) 

They have prata here as well, but no hurry to try as I've eaten at Srisun (Sgoon Gdns) before -- I expect a similar standard (though I think it had gone down quite a bit over the years ).

I checked if they had to re-fry the rojak pieces, as I'd rather not have them oily. Too bad, they had to as some items are actually not fully cooked!

So there went the cuttlefish, deep fried till it had a ""skin"". Definitely not to my liking as it destroyed the texture 

Otherwise, the rojak pieces are rather fresh, as can be seen with the tau kwa 

Potato, small fish cake and plain dough ball were also very good 

So next time I'll just leave out the cuttlefish lol

The gravy is light and hardly contained peanuts!? It tasted slightly spicy, which really went well with the rojak. Usually I will have to ask for another serving... and so I did! 

Strangely, they weren't generous with cut cucumber -- a staple that's great to dunk into the gravy -- and green chilli.

Overall, this was a satisfying and full breakfast. Complete with the requisite teh tarik, of course 

But at $9.90 for this meal -- tea alone is 2.40! -- I'm not keen to return as there are other wallet friendly places to enjoy good rojak!",feedback,visit date: 11 mar 2025 actual rating: 3.5 taking account value money week ago drank teh tarik siu dai know srisun express outlet back eat indian rojak breakfast.... wanted try famous prata hdb block 681 decided pas mhtamchiak keen crispy super oily kosong no matter good curry prata well no hurry try eaten srisun sgoon gdns -- expect similar standard though think gone quite bit year . checked re-fry rojak piece rather not oily. bad item actually not fully cooked went cuttlefish deep fried till skin . definitely not liking destroyed texture otherwise rojak piece rather fresh seen tau kwa potato small fish cake plain dough ball also good next time leave cuttlefish lol gravy light hardly contained peanut tasted slightly spicy really went well rojak. usually ask another serving... strangely generous cut cucumber -- staple great dunk gravy -- green chilli. overall satisfying full breakfast. complete requisite teh tarik course 9.90 meal -- tea alone 2.40 -- not keen return wallet friendly place enjoy good rojak,feedback,0.98,0,0,0,1,0,1
Srisun Express - Hougang Ave 8,3.0,Gavin Koh,"Priced a little too expensive food for a heartland store. My order was $9.40 for 2 egg pratas and 2 teh tariks whereas I could have paid only $6.40 elsewhere.

The scan-the-QR-code-and-order menu wasn't working that well; it was very laggy or seemed to have hung. Even the waitress came to confirm whether I had ordered correctly (after I managed to get it to work on my phone... by patiently waiting). The waitress probably anticipated problems with ordering.

At least the food was hot and arrived quite fast, but the prata looked rather small, as if less dough was used; curry was just enough and quite tasty and slightly crispy. The teh tarik was OK, nothing spectacular.

Srisun Express - Hougang Ave 8,4.0,Josh Kuek (#jkgourmets),"Newest Indian Mamak stall in Hougang. Located in the corner beside cross junction traffic. Very spacious and well decorated, quite comfortable and cossy seating near the roadside.

They serve full Indian menu from Prata, Dosai to Rojak, Briyani to all stir fried comfort foods and of course all traditional drinks.

First, we try their Indian Rojak, very crispy and quite fresh fried stuffed. Dipping potato chilli gravy was not bad too.
We also tried their Dosai, just the plain one, taste was good unfortunately not so crispy and dipping sauces was slightly not to plain, lack of flavours.

In the other day, we take away 2 pieces of grilled Naan bread, wow, it was very fluffy, fragrance, and delicious. Slight sweet and savory taste. Veylry well balanced flavors. Unfortunately, 2 pieces cost $5.50 was too expensive, it was only a plain bread without filling.

On my third visit, trying new dishes, instead of plain thosai, this time I try masala thosai, which is potatoes fillings, very delicious, worth my first try. Yummy.

Another new dish was a fried Bee Hoon with tandoori chicken set, price at $13 each. You have option of the carb, either Fried Rice, Mee, Bee Hoon, Kway-Tiao or Maggi Mee. It was delicious, especially my fried Bee-Hoon, is moist and not oily, and full of wok-hey. Tandoori chicken is yummy but slightly dry inside, can be better.

Overall, I do recommend this Indian stall to all, due to it tidy, clean, comfort and cossy atmosphere. Foods was not bad, table and chairs and environment was clean too, unfortunately, price was slightly high for me. Nevertheless, try it especially if you never visit.

Srisun Express - Hougang Ave 8,5.0,Avriel Peter,"Canâ€™t believe what I just ate! Such fantastic indian cuisine. Ive been travelling around trying different indian food, and even had 3 friends from india teaching me how to eat poori, naan and all sorts of interesting food yesterday. Decided to try Sri Sun today since it is close to my home.

The cost is really good. Higher than other places, but the value was so much more! Eg the poori came with a wholesome amount of potato filling. My nasi briyani was placed beautifully with tender succulent chicken. The curry is thick, savoury, and very flavourful.

Environment is ok. We had 7 pax, which they could handle, but 8 would not cut it unless you want a separate table.

Nitha helped us most of the time, and could explain even more on each dish (yes, we were adventurous and wanted to add some food we have not yet tasted).

Every dish that I often travel around trying, was cooked to perfection (I dare say better). Generosity from drinks to food and sauces made the meal joyful and fulfilling.

I am coming back for sure!

Couple of things for improvement:
1. Papadom was soft and hence hard to eat.
2. Needs cooling. An internal aircon or something that can cool down the place.
3. More sitting areas for 8-10pax.

Ill be sure to make a special request on #1 to be done right the next time I visit.

Srisun Express - Hougang Ave 8,4.0,Makan Thoughts,"Srisun Express on Hougang Ave. 8 has been a hidden culinary gem, offering a delectable variety of fusion dishes bound to satisfy any craving. One dish that truly stood out during my visit was the Mee Goreng with Chicken Tikka and Prata.

The Mee Goreng, a quintessential Malaysian dish, was flawlessly executed at Srisun Express. The noodles were stir-fried to perfection, carrying a deep smoky flavor with a hint of spiciness. What made this particular version unique and noteworthy was the inclusion of tender Chicken Tikka pieces that added an extra dimension of taste to the dish. The flavors were well balanced, and the chicken tikka enhanced the overall savory experience. Unlike other Tikka, this is fresh from lived grill and not in microwave oven.

Accompanying the Mee Goreng was a side of Prata, which turned out to be a heavenly addition to the meal. The prata, with its crispy yet soft texture, was served piping hot and paired perfectly with the savory flavors of the Mee Goreng. It was truly a match made in culinary heaven.

The portion size was generous, ensuring that I left the restaurant feeling completely satisfied. The prices at Srisun Express are also quite reasonable for the quality and quantity of food served, making it a great value for money dining option.

Hotel Calmo Bugis,1.0,Jobelle Ann Ramos,"Take a look at the photos of the rooms, and reduce your expectations by 20x. In person, these rooms look unfinished, cluttered and can barely be called neat.

Looking at the triple room? Decrease your expectations by a further 10x. If they give you the corner rooms, 601 and 605, you'll get a little more real estate than the middle rooms. The double bed is okay, serves it's purpose and can definitely fit 2 comfortably even with a baby in between. The extra bed though, is just a single couch with an ottoman added to the end held together by a fitted sheet. And no it's not one of those plush couches, it's as cheap as couches get.

The bathroom is certainly decent. Sizeable enough with a hot and cold shower. If you're on the plus size of things, the toilet is a bit of a squeeze.

Now for the horror story. Of the 3 days we spent in this hotel, we were only able to use the elevators, twice. Twice! And we were on the 6th floor, a group that had senior citizens and a toddler. so to cap off every day of adventure, we had to go walk up the stairs to the 6th floor. We didn't even complain about it anymore, not allowing it ruin our vacation.

The day before were to depart, we gave them a heads up to let them know that we had 13 pcs of luggage between all of us and that at no point were we bringing these down the stairs ourselves. We gave them advanced notice so that they could make arrangements for this. The receptionist even tried to say they would ""help"" us carry the bags down, but we were clear to her that we would not carry 1 bag down. We were clear that they needed to carry all 13 down.

We were travelling with a toddler, and family who were in their late 40s and 50s and who all had their own share of aches and pains. We did not want to risk anyone getting injured carrying these heavy bags down flights of stairs.

Day of departure came, and they did not arrange anything. The receptionist did nothing at all to prepare, and had to carry some of the bags herself and had to wait for another staff to carry the heavier bags. we checked out at 9 am and this whole ordeal ate into our last day which was supposed to be spent enjoying more of Singapore. We were finally able to leave the hotel at 11 am,

If youâ€™re coming from Changi, just take the Green Line to Bugis station.

Check-in was fast and easy. Just remember to get SGD first since thereâ€™s a 100$ deposit. Theyâ€™ll give you a receipt. Keep it so you can get the deposit back.

Evevator was a bit confusing. Just make sure to tap your access card before pressing the floor, and not the other way around.

When we entered the room, it was spacious. Industrial design. Can easily lay 3 open luggages. Theres also a water heater, iron, hairblower, and iron rack, TV, mini fridge, and AC unit.

In the shower, there was hot and cold water for both the shower and sink.

TAKE NOTE, THEREâ€™S A BIDET! â€” not all hotel in SG have a Bidet. Only a handful actually. And Hotel Calmo Bugis is one of them.

The alley adjacent to the hotel are all food stalls so no need to worry about food. Theres also a convenience store at the other end. Bugis junction and Alberts Hawker are just a few minutes away if you want to save on money for food, or buy souvenirs.

Hotel Calmo Bugis,2.0,Royals Capital,"When We stay here on Saturday, it was pleasant.
The room is not that big as like other Singapore budget hotel. Itâ€™s like an apartment studio. Thereâ€™s microwave and pantry on the 2nd floor. The location is quite strategic, lots of resto bars and shopping centre around the area. The hot water, wifi are good. The TV channel isnâ€™t good, only 4 channel works and most channel are blinking. I will give it 4 stars.

Yet, when We come back to the hotel 4 days after that, the reception girl accused Us that we broke the toilet cups and We must pay for $20. Offcourse We donâ€™t want to pay as they have no prove that We broke it 4 days ago. We already put $100 deposit for each room, and when We check out 4 days before the reception said everything is good. This is the first time We had an experience like this.
What happen if We didnâ€™t come back to that Hotel, how are you going to charge us?

The reception said She called her boss, by the way she doesnâ€™t called in front of us. She then come back and said the boss will waive the broken cups and if itâ€™s happen again they will charge Us for $100. When we check out, the reception check our rooms and we offer to check it together, but she doesnâ€™t want as she said it was the procedure.

Hey boss, if you read this you better learn about hotel management and customer satisfactions. If you argue to your customer, even though you win, yet you still lose the customer.

For other customer that want to stay in this hotel, make sure you make a unboxing room video, as they might accuse you broke something and take advantages. Another tips, ask to get new linen and pillow case, as Iâ€™m sure they didnâ€™t change to a new one when the customer before you check out.

The receptionist are not friendly at all, rude, no smile, not even greetings you. If you ask questions or request something, they will reply like you are stupid and its like you never stayed in a hotel before.

What we like only the bathroom that is quite spacious, cleanliness just average ( we found some hairs on the bed)

30 mins later, I called him over to checked the status of my order, to which he seemed confused. He repeated my order, and I saw him walking over to another female staff gesturing towards me.

Well, another 45 mins went by and my food shows no signs of arriving.

Kazokutei,1.0,Zack Tan,"Food was so-so. But given the price you pay for it, I can close an eye.

Service and hygiene leaves a tremendous lot to be desired though. Throughout my meal, there was a huge bug flying around and the waiters did not notice it. Fair enough, given that they don't walk around the restaurant much as orders are made via iPads chained to the tables and all they do is bring food to you.

I alerted a waitress to the insect who looked at it, smiled, then walked away without even giving an apology, let alone attempt to get rid of the pest.

My order was the promotional Mentaiko cream udon with California Maki. The mentaiko was bland and the egg served with the udon (which wasn't even the typical runny type normally served with ramen/udon) was cold and unappetizing. Maki was just average. All this set me back by $15.90.

Luckily I order/asked for no spring onions if not worse the housefly will be hidden mix up ...
Totally making us to puke after seeing it and no more appetite to continue eating both .. Really can't believe a dead housefly can' be served on the curry udon to us..
Plus took long time somehow the service staffs can't even gave proper explanation when feedback given both OR even no apologies given by a single kitchen staff .Shame . .
So we decided to leave the restaurant as it's a waste of time talking to the staffs ..
Pls kindly look into this matter and update on it asap.. thank u

Newton Food Centre,4.0,OceanSevens,"A little ways from Orchard Rd is Newtown Hawker Centre. I needed to try hawker street style and certainly Singapore is one of the places to try.

Many kiosk fill up the compound and from the crosssing bridge, one can smell the aroma of the satays, stir friend noodles, fresh seafood on the grill.  Upon arrival, there will be several hawkers from calling out to you, waving the gigantic menus whilst the eyes scan the place for the available seats.

After 15 mins of circling the entire food centre, we settled into Newtown 51 - pretty much wok cooked, Chinese concept meals. We order char stir friend noodles, crispy omelet dish and turnip wok-cooked, I was refused the sale of plain steamed rice from the place and next door restaurant which was bizarre and moreso a rude, flat out refusal to sell rice because we did not dine with them.

The food, overall was good. tasty, quickly cooked and price is reasonable for the price and the costs of easy dining in SG. The highlight was the drinks which were reasonable.

All in all, I would return again for the buzzing energy of the food stalls and the masses of people they cater to but it would have been more of positive if the locals there were friendlier. But then again, they must be dealing with tourists from all walks of life and franking smiles constantly could be tiresome.

Newton Food Centre,4.0,Takahiro Koyama,"This popular open-air hawker center has major tropical vibesâ€”surrounded by tall palm trees and full of open seating, it's super laid-back and breezy. Food stalls are set up in a big circle around the tables, creating a fun, social atmosphere.

Thereâ€™s a huge variety of food hereâ€”everything from Singaporean classics to Chinese, Malay, Indian, Thai, and even Western dishes. You'll also find stalls for drinks, fresh fruit, and desserts.

Some places serve fancy stuff like chili crab, pepper crab, lobster, and other premium seafood, but the real crowd-pleasers are the local faves like satay, chicken wings, oyster omelets, chicken rice, prawn mee, and carrot cake.

Itâ€™s a go-to late-night spot tooâ€”many stalls stay open past 1 AM, and it gets especially lively on weekends!

The food was delicious overall, though you do see a bit of repetition across the stalls. That said, there are some real gems if you know what to look for. The fishball soup was a standout â€” fresh, flavourful, and comforting. And one particular stall, which boasts a Michelin star and a few celebrity fans, serves fantastic skewers and chicken wings that are absolutely worth trying.

Newton Food Centre,5.0,Michael Connor,"Review: My Incredible Experience at Newton Food Centre, Singapore

Singapore is a paradise for food lovers, and Newton Food Centre is an absolute gem for anyone looking to experience the cityâ€™s famous hawker culture. I had the pleasure of visiting this bustling food haven, and my experience was nothing short of spectacular.

A Culinary Delight: Oyster Omelette

One of the highlights of my visit was indulging in a plate of oyster omelette, a beloved Singaporean dish. The dish was a perfect blend of crispy, golden-brown egg batter and plump, juicy oysters, garnished with fresh cilantro and served with a side of spicy chili sauce. The balance of flavorsâ€”savory, slightly briny from the oysters, and the fiery kick from the sauceâ€”was absolutely divine. Every bite was a delight, especially with the contrast of the crispy edges and the softer, eggy portions. The bustling energy of the hawker stalls, with vendors shouting out orders and the sizzling sounds from the woks, only added to the charm of the meal.

A Vibrant Performance: Lion and Dragon Dance

As if the food wasnâ€™t exciting enough, I was lucky to witness a traditional lion and dragon dance performance at the food centre! The vibrant orange lion heads, with their bold eyes and intricate designs, were lined up in preparation for the show. Behind them, the enormous golden dragon coiled majestically, ready to come to life. The air filled with rhythmic drum beats, the clash of cymbals, and the deep, resonant gongs as the performers brought the lions and dragon to life.

The performance was electrifyingâ€”watching the dancers maneuver the lion heads with such precision and energy was mesmerizing. The dragon slithered and weaved through the crowd, its golden scales shimmering under the bright hawker center lights. The atmosphere was festive, and the crowd was completely captivated, cheering and taking videos of the thrilling spectacle. It was an unforgettable moment that perfectly encapsulated Singaporeâ€™s rich cultural heritage.

The Hawker Experience

Newton Food Centre itself is an experience worth having. The neon-lit beverage stalls, the variety of drinks from fresh sugarcane juice to ice-cold beer, and the energetic hawkers calling out orders make it a lively and exciting spot. The blend of flavors, the sounds of sizzling woks, and the aroma of grilled seafood fill the air, making it a paradise for food lovers.

The Stingray was unique and delicious enough, although probably too spicy for a late night meal. The Kway Teow was generously portioned, but there wasn't much seafood, and the prawns didn't taste fresh.

Despite prohibition, most of the hawker stall owners engage in hawking, trying to pressure you to sit down and order from them, which was off-putting.

Universal Studios Singapore,5.0,Logesh Kumar,"We have visited Universal Studios Singapore last Sunday, had an exciting and memorable experience. The park is easily accessible by various means of transportation, including walking, cable car, bus, metro, car and taxi, making it very convenient to reach.

Despite the large crowds throughout the day, the overall experience was enjoyable. Many visitors began entering the park right at opening time, and most of the popular rides had wait times ranging from 60 to 90 minutes. While the rides themselves are relatively short typically lasting between 60 to 120 seconds they are absolutely worth the wait and deliver a thrilling experience.

For certain rides, bags are not permitted; however, complimentary lockers are available for up to 90 minutes, which is a very practical feature. The park is well-organized, with easy access to restrooms and a wide variety of restaurants. One full day is likely not enough to explore all the rides, attractions, and live events, so planning a longer visit is recommended.

There are also hotels offering the convenience of staying close to the park for those who wish to explore more thoroughly.

We also enjoyed the interactive play areas that were perfect for his age. The Jurassic Park area was another highlight, with exciting attractions that were thrilling for both adults and children. Although some of the larger rides might have been a bit too intense for younger kids, there were plenty of milder attractions like the Madagascar ride, which was a great fit for our little one.

What really stood out was how family-friendly the park is. There are many child-friendly facilities, including spacious baby changing rooms and stroller rentals, which made it so convenient for us as parents. The food options were diverse, catering to all tastes and dietary preferences.

Universal Studios Singapore,5.0,Md. Raisul Islam,"Universal Studios Singapore (USS), located on Sentosa Island, is Southeast Asiaâ€™s first and only Universal Studios theme park. Opened in 2010, it offers a blend of thrilling rides, immersive shows, and family-friendly attractions across seven uniquely themed zones.

The park features over 24 rides and attractions, including popular ones like Transformers: The Ride â€“ 3D, Revenge of the Mummy, and the dueling roller coasters Battlestar Galactica: Human vs. Cylon. These rides deliver high-octane thrills, while family-friendly options like Sesame Street Spaghetti Space Chase and Puss in Boots' Giant Journey provide entertainment for younger visitors.

USS's themed zonesâ€”Hollywood, New York, Sci-Fi City, Ancient Egypt, The Lost World, Far Far Away, and Madagascarâ€”are meticulously designed to transport guests into the worlds of their favorite movies. The recent addition of Minion Land, which opened in February 2025, brings the whimsical world of Despicable Me to life with attractions like Minion Mayhem and the exclusive Buggie Boogie carousel.

For those looking to maximize their experience, the Universal Express Pass offers priority access to select attractions, helping to skip the regular queues. However, it's worth noting that not all rides are included in the Express Pass, and availability is limited, so it's advisable to plan ahead.

Dining options within the park cater to a variety of tastes, from quick bites to sit-down meals. Visitors can enjoy themed eateries that complement the immersive experience of each zone.

While USS offers a compact yet comprehensive theme park experience, some visitors have noted that it can get crowded during peak hours, especially in the afternoon. To make the most of your visit, it's recommended to arrive early, utilize the Express Pass if available, and plan your route to avoid long wait times for popular attractions.

Universal Studios Singapore,4.0,Tara Christides,"This was a fun day out and something to tick off the Singapore bucket list.
We purchased tickets beforehand which I'd definitely recommend doing. We arrived about 30 mins after opening and got straight through within a couple minutes.
Also recommend you download the app for the map, show times and wait times for each ride.

Most rides had a listed wait time of between 20-70 minutes on the app, but we found all of them moved much quicker than that. We also found that wait times became less around the middle part of the day when people were having lunch, and the afternoon when a lot of families with younger kids had left for the day.

There was plenty of shade throughout the whole park and each themed section had it's own food places, pop up carts with ice cold drinks, bathrooms/toilets, water fountains and store for souvenir shopping. There was also lockers throughout so you could lock away bags if you wished while you were on rides.
The entrance/exit to the park has all themed shops so you didn't have to go back if you decided you wanted something.
Stores also deliver your purchases to a concierge at the front of the park so you don't have to carry them around all day.

Food and drink was on the pricier side but we expected this so didn't come as too much of a surprise. There was plenty of food choices with all different cuisines so there'll be something for everyone.

Universal Studios Singapore,4.0,Niel J.,"Universal Studios Singapore may not be the biggest theme park, but itâ€™s packed with excitement and really well-designed. I had such a fun time exploring the different themed zonesâ€”Hollywood, Ancient Egypt, Jurassic Park, Sci-Fi City, and more. Each area is like stepping into a movie set, with detailed scenery and immersive vibes.

One of the highlights for me was the Transformers 4D rideâ€”it was thrilling, fast-paced, and the effects made it feel super real. I also really enjoyed the Jurassic Park Rapids Adventureâ€”just be prepared to get a little wet! If you prefer something more relaxing, there are plenty of family-friendly rides too, like the carousel or Sesame Street-themed attractions.

The live shows were also a nice touch. I caught a stunt performance that was surprisingly intense and well-choreographed. Plus, there are lots of chances to meet characters for photos, which adds to the fun.

My tip: go on a weekday if possible to avoid the long queues, and check the show schedule in advance so you donâ€™t miss anything.

Universal Studios Singapore,2.0,Sebastian ZakÅ‚ada,"First things first - it's super tiny. Compared to Orlando it's a miniature. And that's fine, not everything has to be massive, BUT... what's not tiny in Singapore though is PRICE.

It's ridiculous how expensive it is for what it was. You can walk around the whole place in 10 minutes. We were super lucky since the park was not crowded at all, frankly it was empty. Walk-ins everywhere.

Of course, no drinks from outside of the park are allowed so make sure to bring empty water bottles to fill up at the fountains. Also no outside food is allowed and there is only fast food in the park and the only place where there was enough people to form a crowd was the restaurants. But that's pretty typical of all amusement parks, which in today's times is pretty mind blowing.

Universal Studios Singapore,5.0,navid ghannad,"We visited Universal Studios Singapore on a Wednesday, hoping for a more relaxed experience, but the park turned out to be quite busy throughout the day. Wait times for popular rides like Transformers, Battlestar Galactica, and Revenge of the Mummy ranged from 60 to 95 minutes, even in the early afternoon. The crowd levels were unexpectedly high for midweek, which seems to align with what others have reported about the parkâ€™s compact layout and consistently high demand.

One factor that made our visit far smoother was receiving a Guest Assistance Pass (GAP). After presenting a dated doctorâ€™s note and brief explanation at Guest Services near the entrance, we were issued a physical pass that allowed us to access the express lanes via timed return entries. While it might initially feel awkward to disclose medical information, I fully understand the need for documentation to ensure the system is used fairly. The staff handling this process were exceptionally friendly, patient, and respectful, which made the whole procedure feel both professional and supportive.

The GAP system itself was easy to use. At each attraction, we showed the pass, were given a return time (typically a bit shorter than the posted wait), and returned through the express entrance. The setup isnâ€™t digital, unlike systems at some other parks, but it worked reliably and removed much of the exhaustion that extended queueing might otherwise have caused.

The attractions lived up to expectations. Transformers delivered an intense and immersive 3D experience. Battlestar Galacticaâ€™s twin coasters were thrilling, with the Human track offering a smoother, more comfortable ride. Revenge of the Mummy combined dark ride elements with sudden drops and sharp turns, remaining one of the parkâ€™s highlights. We also appreciated Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure, a water ride that was both fun and surprisingly long, and Shrek 4D, which offered a lighthearted pause from the more intense experiences.

We had lunch at one of the food outlets inside the park and chose the Family Feast set. For SGD 88, it included two large soups, one large pizza, four desserts, and four soft drinks. It wasnâ€™t gourmet, but the portions were generous, the food was decent, and the pricing was fair by theme park standards. It made for an easy and efficient shared lunch.

What stood out beyond the attractions themselves was the attitude of the staff. Every person we encounteredâ€”from the ride attendants to the Guest Services teamâ€”was polite, accommodating, and genuinely understanding. They took their time to explain the procedures, never made us feel rushed or scrutinized, and showed a level of professionalism that added a human warmth to the day.

Even with the long lines and high visitor numbers, we came away feeling that the park experience had been well thought out, especially for guests with specific needs. The GAP made a significant difference, and while the requirement to show medical documentation is understandable, the process was handled with empathy and discretion. All in all, it was a memorable visit, made smoother by thoughtful accommodations and excellent staff interactions.",feedback,visited universal studio singapore wednesday hoping relaxed experience park turned quite busy throughout day. wait time popular ride like transformer battlestar galactica revenge mummy ranged 60 95 minute even early afternoon. crowd level unexpectedly high midweek seems align others reported park compact layout consistently high demand. one factor made visit far smoother receiving guest assistance pas gap . presenting dated doctor note brief explanation guest service near entrance issued physical pas allowed u access express lane via timed return entries. might initially feel awkward disclose medical information fully understand need documentation ensure system used fairly. staff handling process exceptionally friendly patient respectful made whole procedure feel professional supportive. gap system easy use. attraction showed pas given return time typically bit shorter posted wait returned express entrance. setup digital unlike system park worked reliably removed much exhaustion extended queueing might otherwise caused. attraction lived expectations. transformer delivered intense immersive 3d experience. battlestar galactica twin coaster thrilling human track offering smoother comfortable ride. revenge mummy combined dark ride element sudden drop sharp turn remaining one park highlights. also appreciated jurassic park rapid adventure water ride fun surprisingly long shrek 4d offered lighthearted pause intense experiences. lunch one food outlet inside park chose family feast set. sgd 88 included two large soup one large pizza four dessert four soft drinks. gourmet portion generous food decent pricing fair theme park standards. made easy efficient shared lunch. stood beyond attraction attitude staff. every person encountered ride attendant guest service team polite accommodating genuinely understanding. took time explain procedure never made u feel rushed scrutinized showed level professionalism added human warmth day. even long line high visitor number came away feeling park experience well thought especially guest specific needs. gap made significant difference requirement show medical documentation understandable process handled empathy discretion. memorable visit made smoother thoughtful accommodation excellent staff interactions.,feedback,1.0,0,0,0,1,0,1

Universal Studios Singapore,5.0,Abiyyu Raihan Putra Wikanto,"One of the most-visited destination in Singapore! Most groups probably have this place in their itinerary if they're going to Singapore...

Basically it'a theme park located in an island south of Singapore. Connected by a monorail to VivoCity Mall which is interestingly only charged if you're going Sentosa Island.

The theme park is very big. There is :
â€¢ Egypt section with an amazing cafetaria,
â€¢ A 1920's USA style town,
â€¢ Lots of rail that includes amusement rides and roller coaster,
â€¢ A big lake in the middle,
â€¢ Castle with dreamworks character (puss in boots and others),
â€¢ Waterworld show,
â€¢ Battlestar Galactica section with a thrilling rollercoaster (there is locker to store items to here),
â€¢ Transformer amusement ride that feels 3D,
â€¢ Sesame street small amusement ride.

You could probably spend half a days here. Brings your friend and family. Do note that while some places here offer halal food, it is quite costly. Prices can be up to 14$ for butter chicken rice (tasty tho). There is an option to just eat at a cafetaria outside which is cheaper and do have halal food.

Newton Food Centre,4.0,Arjun Butani,"I last came to the Newton food center pre-pandemic and then not again. I was afraid it had lost it's buzz and it's best food stalls. Tonight I returned and what a meal it was.
Singapore is one place where I feel safe eating streetfood.

This is everything I ate. The singapore special, chilli mud crab. Thank god I wore a black t-shirt because it was truly a hot mess. I had this with a side of egg fried rice. The next two are king prawns, in their shells, baked in butter and topped with a copious amounts of garlic. What was interesting about it was that instead of a lime/lemon wedge, it had a mandarin orange wedge. So I squeezed in the orange juice, and it completed the dish.

Then two exotic meats, first the stingray fin, grilled and then topped with a spicy bean sauce. The meat of stingray is flaky, like cod but chewy like shrimp- so the taste of it is somewhere between a fish and shellfish- and slightly sweet too. The gonggong or sea snails or conch, were melting in my mouth. They were slowly steamed with butter and then served with a very hot sauce. Messy and tedious to pull out and eat but so worth it- nowhere else would I eat the conch snails. The dish after that is a crispy small squid, chopped and fried and then tossed with chilli sauce.
Then the dessert because those who know me, know that I take dessert seriously and for me it's my favourite part of the dish. It's an ice kachang- shaved ice, topped with syrups such as rose. Additions to it include grass jelly, red beans, longan fruit, coconut jelly and corn. It's an iconic Asian dessert, popular across Malaysia too. The other dessert is a simple mangos with longan fruit. The other two dishes are, one an omelette and a cheese roti paratta, a malayu-indian rendition to the simple parantha - which was served with a chicken curry.

What fun being back here and what fun eating streetfood guilt free. The market is back to normal, buzzing with tables full of friends, families and lovers.

Second option you buy the early access pass but for me it was expensive still if it allows your pocket I suggest those take the pass once you entered in the universal studio. early access passes are available inside. Do not try to do first ride without pass because your ride make take longer waiting time and after do one or two rides there is wastage of money if you buy early pass after that.

Universal Studios Singapore might be smaller than other Universal parks, but itâ€™s incredibly well done and full of excitement. The rides are top-notch â€” Transformers, Jurassic Park and Revenge of the Mummy were my favorites, and Battlestar Galactica is a must if you love rollercoasters. And also make sure to keep track of the water show schedule as well, also very recommend to watch.

The park is clean, well-organized, and easy to get around. Great mix of attractions for all ages, from high-adrenaline rides to fun shows and kid-friendly zones. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the atmosphere throughout the park was lively and enjoyable.

Universal Studios Singapore,5.0,Han Zaw Oo,"It has so many fun ride inside for kids friendly and adult. Height limitations are applied for certain rides. When we arrived 9:45 (15 min before open), it had a long queue. Express ticket is available at the ticket counter but better check the volume of ppl inside prior buying. Express ticket could buy inside as well. If you come since opening and not much interested in some rides, better not buy - not worth to pay. After lunch time, some rides are no more queue.

We enjoyed for 4D rides in Far Far Way, Minions and Jurassic rides. Target to finish all rides by lunch time then you could repeat which rides you like. Some rides need to keep your belongings but pay-locker are available. If you rent pay-locker, pls keep till you finish other rides as it ll make you repetitive renting and cost you a lot.

Lunch inside is too expensive compared to portion. Drinking Water could get at each station. Better bring rain coat or umbrella cos rain is unpredictable. If not rain, it ll be too hot, so better bring umbrella.

Car park is max SGD 16-17 per day and easy to access.

Universal Studios Singapore,1.0,Peer,"Unbelievable how this park has been declining in the past few years.
The problem is simple: they sell too many tickets, and offer way too little rides and shows in return. Visiting on a Monday with very bad weather, (rainfall all day) the queues for all the main rides were 2/3 or more hours with no exceptions all day long. During my visit I managed to ride 2 attractions whilst being in the park for 7 hours.

They have a terrible Regular & Express pass division which is purely meant to milk more money out of people. With a regular entry, expect to be queuing for 3 hours for the main ride (Human/Cylon) and 1-2 hours for all the other rides, even the carousel was an hour wait. It gets so bad that they end up temporarily closing big rides to prevent queue overflowing. The irony is that the rides arenâ€™t exactly in great condition, lots of them with broken animatronics & effects.

You end up being pretty much forced to purchase overpriced express lane tickets just to be able to ride more than a handful of rides.

Despite all of this, the staff was still kind and tried their best to assist the hoards of visibly frustrated visitors. The park simply need to put a cap on the amount of visitors allowed into the rather small park, donâ€™t waste your money on this place until they clean up their mess.

Getting to sentosa Island is straightforward and can easily be done with public transport.

The set decorations and characters here are plentiful and beautifully crafted. There are plenty of photo opportunities to take with them.

There is however a lack of ventilation and fans here. When waiting for the rides or attractions there was a lack of fans. Everybody around me was complaining with many children crying and people tired before the attraction even started. So many times I thought I would pass out from the heat.

The only place with proper ventilation and air conditioning was inside the gift shops. A lot of people were standing and sitting inside there because it was so hot outside.
I would recommend for more indoor seating or seating with shade that is accessible for visitors.

The shrek 4d show was good and worth waiting for. The waiting room there at least had an air conditioner.

The lights, camera actions attraction was good but would have been better if there was more to see. The wait times was listed 15 minutes but was definitely more than that.

The food was of course overpriced, which is to be expected. We had the burgers from the diner and they tasted okay and were served with fries.
